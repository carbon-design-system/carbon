[![Edit carbon-web-components](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/main/packages/carbon-web-components/examples/codesandbox/basic/components/tile)

Tiles are a highly flexible component for displaying a wide variety of content,
including informational, getting started, how-to, next steps, and more.

Carbon ships a basic tile structure that responds to the grid. Tiles have no
pre-set styles for the content within them. You can customize tiles to fit your
specific use case.

When using a call-to-action (CTA) within a tile, use a secondary button. Primary
buttons should be reserved for the most important action a user can take on the
page.

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/tile/index.js';
```

<Description markdown={`${cdnJs({ components: ['tile'] })}`} />
<Description markdown={`${cdnCss()}`} />

### HTML

```html
<cds-tile>Default tile</cds-tile>
```

## Read-only tile (default)

Read-only tiles are used to display information to the user, such as features or
services offered. Read-only tiles are often seen on marketing pages to promote
content. These tiles can have internal calls-to-action (CTAs), such as a button
or a link.

## Clickable tile

Clickable tiles can be used as navigational items, where the entire tile is a
clickable state, which redirects the user to a new page. Clickable tiles cannot
contain separate internal CTAs.

```html
<cds-clickable-tile> Clickable tile </cds-clickable-tile>
```

## `<cds-clickable-tile>` attributes and properties

<Props of="cds-clickable-tile" />

## Selectable tile

Selectable tiles work like a radio button, where the entire tile is a click
target. Selectable tiles may contain internal CTAs (like links to docs) if the
internal CTA is given its own click target. Selectable tiles work well for
presenting options to a user in a structured manner, such as a set of pricing
plans.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Single-select tiles</legend>
  <cds-radio-tile name="selectable-tile"> Single-select Tile </cds-radio-tile>
  <cds-radio-tile name="selectable-tile"> Single-select Tile </cds-radio-tile>
  <cds-radio-tile name="selectable-tile"> Single-select Tile </cds-radio-tile>
</fieldset>
```

## `<cds-radio-tile>` attributes and properties

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g.
`<cds-radio-tile selected>`) and `false` means not setting the attribute (e.g.
`<cds-radio-tile>` without `selected` attribute).

<Props of="cds-radio-tile" />

## Multi-selectable tile

```html
<cds-selectable-tile name="selectable-tile">
  Multi-select Tile
</cds-selectable-tile>
```

## `<cds-selectable-tile>` attributes and properties and events

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g.
`<cds-selectable-tile selected>`) and `false` means not setting the attribute
(e.g. `<cds-selectable-tile>` without `selected` attribute).

<Props of="cds-selectable-tile" />

## Expandable tile

Expandable tiles are helpful for hiding/showing larger amounts of content to a
user. They can only be stacked in a single column, and cannot live in a row or
horizontal grid. When expanded, tiles push content down the page. Expandable
tiles may contain internal CTAs (like links to docs) if the internal CTA is
given its own click target.

```html
<cds-expandable-tile>
  <cds-tile-above-the-fold-content
    slot="above-the-fold-content"
    style="height: 200px"
  >
    Above the fold content here
  </cds-tile-above-the-fold-content>
  <cds-tile-below-the-fold-content style="height: 300px">
    Below the fold content here
  </cds-tile-below-the-fold-content>
</cds-expandable-tile>
```

## `<cds-expandable-tile>` attributes, properties and events

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g.
`<cds-expandable-tile expanded>`) and `false` means not setting the attribute
(e.g. `<cds-expandable-tile>` without `expanded` attribute).

<Props of="cds-expandable-tile" />
