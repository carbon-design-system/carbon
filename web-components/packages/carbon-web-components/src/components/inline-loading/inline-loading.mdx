Inline loading spinners are used when performing actions. They help notify
user’s that their action is being processed. The waiting experience is a crucial
design opportunity. Although it may not be obvious what is occurring on the
back-end, we can communicate clearly to reassure the user that progress is
happening.

It is best practice to use an Inline loading component for any Create, Update,
or Delete actions. The component provides feedback to the user about the
progress of the action they took. This could be in a table, after a primary or
secondary button click, or even in a modal.

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/inline-loading/index.js';
```

<Markdown>{`${cdnJs({ components: ['inline-loading'] })}`}</Markdown>
<Markdown>{`${cdnCss()}`}</Markdown>

### HTML

```html
<cds-inline-loading status="active">Loading data...</cds-inline-loading>
```

## `<cds-inline-loading>` attributes and properties

<ArgsTable of="cds-inline-loading" />
