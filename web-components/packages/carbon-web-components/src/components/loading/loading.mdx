[![Edit carbon-web-components](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/main/packages/carbon-web-components/examples/stackblitz/basic/components/loading)

Loading spinners are used when retrieving data or performing slow computations,
and help to notify users that loading is underway. The waiting experience is a
crucial design opportunity. Although it may not be obvious what is occurring on
the back-end, we can communicate clearly to reassure the user that progress is
happening.

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/loading/index.js';
```

<Markdown>{`${cdnJs({ components: ['loading'] })}`}</Markdown>
<Markdown>{`${cdnCss()}`}</Markdown>

### HTML

```html
<div style="position: relative; padding: 3rem; display: flex;">
  <cds-loading></cds-loading>
</div>
```

## `<cds-loading>` attributes and properties

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g.
`<cds-loading inactive>`) and `false` means not setting the attribute (e.g.
`<cds-loading>` without `inactive` attribute).

<ArgsTable of="cds-loading" />
