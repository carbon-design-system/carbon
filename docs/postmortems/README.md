## Process

- Copy the [Postmortem template](./00-template.md) over to a new file
- This file should be named: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
  - For example: `10-11-05-critical-layout-breaking-change.md`
- Fill out the template as best you can, be as detailed as needed
- Submit a Pull Request to the project, make sure to include anyone involved in
  the incident as a reviewer so they can provide additional perspectives if
  needed
