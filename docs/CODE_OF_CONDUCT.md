# Carbon Code of Conduct

## TL;DR

- **Be respectful & understanding.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but
  disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. It is important
  that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
  people of all backgrounds and identities.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Degrading, demeaning or disrespectful comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including _but not
limited to_ GitHub, e-mail and Slack. It also applies when an individual is
representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at carbon@us.ibm.com. All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to
maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Slack

1.  Please, no `@here` or `@channel` unless it is a bug that is **breaking
    production code.** We have communities in many different time zones, and we
    would hate to disrupt someone not at the office.
2.  There's no need to notify the Carbon team that you have made an issue in
    Carbon's GitHub repositories. We check these several times a day, so we
    promise we'll address your issue as soon as we can.
3.  Reserve direct messages for sensitive discussions, such as privacy, legal,
    or HR reasons. Otherwise, we encourage posting in public channels so people
    with the same questions can benefit.
4.  If you have a pressing bug fix, it is best to make a PR directly to get your
    issues addressed.
5.  `#carbon-components`: This channel is for questions about Carbon Components
    only. It is not the place to ask general coding questions. Instead, use a
    dev community like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
6.  `#carbon-design-system`: Please post any design questions with an in-context
    screen shot (i.e. screen shot of the whole UI you are designing) with
    background as to what you are trying to accomplish in this flow. We welcome
    in-progress work to get community design feedback as well.
