## Upgrade paths

### carbon-components

This upgrade is common for teams that may be using only the styles from Carbon.
It may also be for teams who use the Vanilla JavaScript version of components.

Note: parts of this upgrade can be automated by running the following command in
your project:

```bash
npx @carbon/upgrade
```

- [Automated] Remove `carbon-components`
- [Automated] Add `@carbon/styles`
- Update to Dart Sass
- Update imports
  - `@use`
  - `@import`
  - Changes to `vendor`
- Changes to Design Tokens
  - Compatability theme

### carbon-components, carbon-components-react, carbon-icons

This upgrade is one of the most common upgrade paths for Carbon. This path
assumes that you are bringing in the styles from `carbon-components` and are
using the React components from `carbon-components-react`.

Note: parts of this upgrade can be automated by running the following command in
your project:

```bash
npx @carbon/upgrade
```

- [Automated] Remove `carbon-components`
- [Automated] Remove `carbon-components-react`
- [Automated] Remove `carbon-icons`
- [Automated] Add `@carbon/react`
  - [Automated] Update all React imports to `@carbon/react`
  - Update to Dart Sass
  - Update all scss imports to `@carbon/react/scss/*`

### carbon-components, carbon-components-react, carbon-icons, @carbon/icons-react

This upgrade is one of the most common upgrade paths for Carbon. This path
assumes that you are bringing in the styles from `carbon-components`, using the
React components from `carbon-components-react`, and you bring in icons using
`@carbon/icons-react`.

Note: parts of this upgrade can be automated by running the following command in
your project:

```bash
npx @carbon/upgrade
```

- [Automated] Remove `carbon-components`
- [Automated] Remove `carbon-components-react`
- [Automated] Remove `carbon-icons`

  - [Automated] Update all React imports to `@carbon/react`
  - Update to Dart Sass
  - Update all scss imports to `@carbon/react/scss/*`
  - Update all icon imports to `@carbon/react/icons`

## carbon-components

In v10, the `carbon-componnets` package ships Sass styles and Vanilla JavaScript
for components in our Design System. Starting in v11, we will split out our
styles into a dedicated package: `@carbon/styles`. In addition, we will no
longer support the Vanilla JavaScript for our components.

_Note: if you interested in continuing support for the Vanilla JavaScript
components in `carbon-components`, reach out in our discussion [here](#todo)._

### Changing from `node-sass` to `sass`

Along with this change, the styles of Carbon have been completely updated to use
[Sass Modules](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-sass-modules/). This change
requires that teams use the [Dart Sass](https://npmjs.com/package/sass) package.
Support for `node-sass` has been dropped starting in v11.

This decision was made after seeing the
[deprecation notice](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) of
LibSass in late 2020.

### Changing import paths from `scss/globals/scss` to `scss`

With this change to Sass Modules, you'll find that many of the ways that you are
using Carbon today have been updated and streamlined. In general, most paths
have changed from the long form `scss/globals/scss/path/to/file` to simply
`scss/path/to/file`.

For example, to access the `theme` entrypoint you would have needed to import
`scss/globals/scss/theme`. Now, this entrypoint lives at `scss/theme`.

Alongside the updates to filepaths, you will find that helper mixins, functions,
and variables have been updated to no longer have a `carbon--` prefix. With Sass
Modules, the module name now serves as an appropriate prefix and provides
correct scoping.

There are two major areas of changes in the package, namely:

- [`scss/globals/scss`](#scssglobalsscss)
- [`scss/components/`](#scsscomponents)

### scss/globals/scss

The majority of the files currently available under `/scss/globals/scss` are now
available directly under the `scss` directory, or through our new utilities
folder in `scss/utilties`.

Below, you'll find an overview of files that are a part of our Public API and
where they have moved to in v11. Each row also contains a link to a section
below that goes over any API changes for the file.

#### `scss/globals/scss/styles.scss`

| v10                                                          | v11                      |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';` | `@use '@carbon/styles';` |
| (alias)                                                      | `@use '@carbon/react';`  |

The `styles.scss` entrypoint was provided as a way to bring in all of the styles
for the Carbon Design System. In v11, this is available through
`@carbon/styles/index.scss` which can be directly imported with `@use` by
writing out:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles';
```

If you are overriding different settings of the project, like `$prefix`, you
will need to pass those into the `with` block in the import:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles' with (
  $prefix: 'cds',
);
```

For a full overview of changes to how you configure Carbon, checkout our
[configuration](#configuration) section below.

#### `scss/globals/scss/_colors.scss`

| v10                                                     | v11                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/colors';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/colors';` |
|                                                         | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/colors';`  |

The `scss/globals/scss/_colors.scss` entrypoint provided a re-export of the
`@carbon/colors` package. This entrypoint now lives at `scss/_colors.scss` in
`@carbon/styles` and can be included by writing:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/colors';

.example {
  color: colors.$blue-50;
}
```

The following is a list of API changes in v11 for `@carbon/colors` that are
present in `@carbon/styles/scss/colors`:

| v10                     | v11                            |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `$ibm-*` variables      | Removed                        |
| `$carbon-*` variables   | Removed                        |
| `$ibm-color-map`        | Removed                        |
| `$carbon--colors`       | Removed, replaced by `$colors` |
| `@mixin ibm--colors`    | Removed                        |
| `@mixin carbon--colors` | Removed                        |

#### `scss/globals/scss/_css--body.scss`

TODO

#### `scss/globals/scss/_css--font-face.scss`

Beginning in V11, the `@ibm/plex` package will be included as a dependency of
`@carbon/styles`. Because of this, we will no longer be serving the files via
Google Fonts. You will get the fonts by default by importing from the main
entrypoint (`@use '@carbon/styles'`), or by referencing the font face file
directly (`@use '@carbon/styles/scss/font-face'`). If you are already hosting
the font files, and do not want the font files to be emitted, you can set the
`$css--font-face` variable to `false`.

#### `scss/globals/scss/_css--helpers.scss`

The `scss/globals/scss/_css--helpers` entrypoint provides class-based helpers
when the `$css--helpers` flag is set to true, specifically:

- `bx--assistive-text` and `bx--visually-hidden`
- `bx--body`

In v11, the assistive text and visually hidden classes are now available under:
`scss/utilities/_visually-hidden`.

TODO `bx--body`

#### `scss/globals/scss/_css--reset.scss`

| v10                                                         | v11                                 |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/css--reset';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/reset';` |

The `scss/globals/scss/css--reset` entrypoint is used for including a CSS reset
in a project using Carbon. It is configurable using the `$css--reset` global
flag.

In v11, this entrypoint is now available at `scss/reset` and is still
configurable with the `$css--reset` configuration option. By default,
`$css--reset` is set to `true`.

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/config' with (
  $css--reset: true,
);
@use '`@carbon/styles/scss/reset';
```

#### `scss/globals/scss/_helper-classes.scss`

The `scss/globals/scss/_helper-classes.scss` entrypoint was used to emit CSS
classes for text truncation, specifically:

- `bx--text-truncate--end`
- `bx--text-truncate--front`

TODO

#### `scss/globals/scss/_helper-mixins.scss`

The `scss/globals/scss/_helper-mixins.scss` entrypoint exported a number of
helper mixins that could be used when building components. In v11, these helpers
have been moved to utilities located under `scss/utilities/`. Below is a table
that details to which files a particular helper has been moved.

| v10                         | v11                                       |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `@mixin text-overflow`      | `scss/utilities/_text-overflow.scss`      |
| `@mixin placeholder-colors` | `scss/utilities/_placeholder-colors.scss` |
| `@mixin box-shadow`         | `scss/utilities/_box-shadow.scss`         |
| `@mixin focus-outline`      | `scss/utilities/_focus-outline.scss`      |
| `@mixin rotate`             | `scss/utilities/_rotate.scss`             |
| `@mixin hidden`             | TODO                                      |
| `@mixin button-reset`       | `scss/utilities/_button-reset.scss`       |
| `@mixin skeleton`           | `scss/utilities/_skeleton.scss`           |
| `@keyframes skeleton`       | `scss/utilities/_keyframes.scss` TODO     |
| `@mixin high-contrast-mode` | `scss/utilities/_high-contrast-mode.scss` |

#### `scss/globals/scss/_layout.scss`

TODO

#### `scss/globals/scss/_mixins.scss`

The `scss/globals/scss/_mixins.scss` entrypoint re-exported mixins from the
following files:

- `scss/globals/scss/helper-mixins`
- `scss/components/button/mixins`;
- `scss/components/loading/mixins`;
- `scss/components/notification/mixins`;
- `scss/components/tag/mixins`;
- `scss/components/structured-list/mixins`;

In v11, this entrypoint has been removed. If you are using a mixin from this
entrypoint, find the appropriate mixin from the migration guidance for one of
the files above.

TODO: anything else we can offer for guidance here?

#### `scss/globals/scss/_motion.scss`

| v10                                                     | v11                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/motion';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/motion';` |

The `scss/globals/scss/_motion.scss` entrypoint re-exported exports from the
`@carbon/motion` package along with providing a number of helpers and variables
for duration and easing curves.

| v10                        | v11                                |

| `$duration--fast-01`       | `$duration-fast-01`                |
| `$duration--fast-02`       | `$duartion-fast-02`                |
| `$duration--moderate-01`   | `$duration-moderate-01`            |
| `$duration--moderate-02`   | `$duration-moderate-01`            |
| `$duration--slow-01`       | `$duration-slow-01`                |
| `$duration--slow-02`       | `$duration-slow-02`                |
| `@function motion`         | No changes                         |
| `@mixin motion`            | No changes                         |

For a full overview of what is available in this entrypoint, check out the
[API documentation](../../packages/motion/docs/sass.md#api) for the
`@carbon/motion` package.

#### `scss/globals/scss/_spacing.scss`

| v10                                                      | v11                                   |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/spacing';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/spacing';` |

The `scss/globals/scss/_spacing.scss` entrypoint provided a number of variables
for spacing and include re-exports from the `@carbon/layout` package for
`mini-unit` support as well as the spacing scale.

In v11, this entrypoint has been moved to `scss/_spacing.scss` and a number of
exports have been changed.

| v10                            | v11                                  |

The `scss/globals/scss/_theme.scss` entrypoint re-exported tokens from the
`_theme-tokens.scss` entrypoint. In v11, you can import this file directly and
reference the current theme, tokens defined in the theme, as well as dynamically
retrieve the current value of a token.

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme';

.example {
  background: theme.$background;
  color: theme.$text-primary;
}

In v11, this entrypoint has been moved to `scss/_type.scss` and several of its
exports have changed or removed.

The `scss/globals/scss/_vars.scss` entrypoint was used to access most of the
public variables from the Carbon Design System. It also specified the `$prefix`
used for CSS.examples in the codebase.

In v11, this file has been removed. To get access to variables that you
previously were using `_vars.scss` for, you will need to find the correct direct
import. For changing the `$prefix` used in the project, you can configure this
through the `scss/_config.scss` entrypoint.

For more information about configuring the project, check out the
[configuration](#configuration) section below.

#### `scss/globals/grid/_grid.scss`

| v10                                                   | v11                                |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/grid/grid';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/grid';` |

The `scss/globals/grid/_grid.scss` entrypoint provides access to the flexbox
based grid from the `@carbon/grid` package.

In v11, this entrypoint has been moved to `scss/_grid.scss` and continues to
re-export from the `@carbon/grid` package. In addition, the default grid has
been changed from the 12 column variant to the 16 column grid.

_Note: if you're using `$feature-flags` to set `grid-columns-16` you can remove
this flag in v11_

Finally, our default grid implementation no longer uses flexbox. Instead, it
uses CSS Grid. For more information about these changes, checkout [todo](#todo).

| v10                         | v11 |
| :-------------------------- | :-- |
| `@mixin grid`               |     |
| `@mixin carbon--grid`       |     |
| `$carbon--12-column-grid`   |     |
| `$carbon--grid-breakpoints` |     |

### scss/components

The components located under `scss/components` are available under
`scss/components/<component>/_<component>.scss`. For example, to import an
accordion:

```scss
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/accordion/accordion';
```

In v11, these files now live at `scss/components/<component>/_index.scss` and
can be shortened to `scss/components/<component>` since Dart Sass resolves
`_index.scss` files automatically. for example:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/accordion';
```

### Configuration

In v10, you could configure various aspects of Carbon using global flags that
were set before including Carbon. For example, you could change the prefix used
or disable the CSS reset that the project used by doing the following:

```scss
$prefix: 'cds';
$css--reset: false;

@import 'path/to/carbon';
```

Similarly, you could enable or disable `$feature-flags` for the project with a
similar approach.

This approach no longer works with the project's switch to Sass Modules.
Instead, you will need to configure Carbon through the `scss/_config.scss`
entrypoint using `with`. This file is re-exported in various entrypoints, so you
can configure Carbon on the main entrypoint:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles' with (
  $prefix: 'cds',
);
```

Or you can configure the `scss/_config.scss` directly:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/config' with (
  $prefix: 'cds',
);
```

_Note: Sass modules can only ever be configured once. Bringing in this module
and configuring it should be one of the first things you do in your project._

The following is a table of configuration options and their status in v11. Ones
that are available you can configure through the `scss/_config.scss` entrypoint,
ones that are removed are no longer available.

| v10               | v11          |
| :---------------- | :----------- |
| `$css--font-face` |              |
| `$css--helpers`   | Removed      |
| `$css--body`      |              |
| `$css--use-layer` | Removed TODO |
| `$css--reset`     |              |
| `$prefix`         |              |
| `$feature-flags`  |              |

## carbon-components-react

The `carbon-components-react` package has been replaced by the `@carbon/react`
package in v11. While you can still use `carbon-components-react` along with
v11, it has been deprecated and will stop receiving updates when v12 is
released.

In addition, this release contains updates to React components in the package.
These updates include:

- Changing components from class components to functional components
- Creating consistent prop names and types across components
- Updates to make components more accessible

For a full overview of changes to components, checkout our components section
below.

hood. However, if you're using the `Grid` component in v10 you can continue
using our flexbox-based grid with the `FlexGrid` component. Similarly, `Row` and
`Column` will continue to work with `FlexGrid`.

With the change to CSS Grid, you now will only need two components to build
layouts: `Grid` and `Column`. The `Row` component is no longer needed.

**New**

- Subgrid is officially supported when using CSS Grid

**Changed**

- The `Grid` component now uses CSS Grid under the hood. If you would like to
  keep using the flexbox-based grid, use `FlexGrid` instead.

### FlexGrid

The `FlexGrid` component has the same API as the `Grid` component in v10. You
can build layouts using `FlexGrid`, `Row`, and `Column`. You can also keep
existing layouts that you've already built using this component.

### Row

This component has not changed between v10 and v11. However, it is no longer
needed when building layouts with `Grid`. Instead, you can use `Grid` and
`Column` directly.

### Column

The `Column` component has specific additions to work with CSS Grid. It
maintains backwards compabaility with v10. The biggest change between v10 and
v11 is that `Columns` no longer will auto-span. Instead, each `Column` will span
1 column in the grid unless otherwise specified.

There are also changes to how `offset` works in v11. While you can continue to
use `offset` in each breakpoint prop, you can now use `start` and `end`, as
well. These correspond to `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end`,
respectively.

View the docs for the [`Column` component](#todo) to learn more.

### Notifications

The notification components have been updated to be more accessible out of the
box. `ToastNotification` and `InlineNotification` now have `role="status"` by
default with additional `role` options of `log` and `alert`. These components do
not receive focus and should be used for information-only use cases. These
components no longer accept actions or interactive children.

For notifications requiring an action, a new `ActionableNotifiation` component
is available. It has a `role="alertdialog"` and recieves focus by default.
Automatic placement of focus can be turned off via the new `hasFocus` prop.

All notifications have a new optional `closeOnEscape` prop, it enables
notifications to closed by pressing the `escape` key. For more details, see the
[notification components accessibility page](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/accessibility).

ToastNotification` updates:

- The `title`, `subtitle` and `caption` props have been removed. Compose
  notification contents using `children` instead.
- `children` can no longer contain interactive elements. A `ToastNotification`
  containing an action or interactive children should be replaced with
  `ActionableNotification`.
- The `notificationType` prop is no longer needed and can be removed.
- The default `role` is now `status`. `log` and `alert` can also be used.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

`InlineNotification` updates:

- The `title`, `subtitle` props have been removed. Compose notification contents
  using `children` instead.
- The `actions` prop has been removed. An `InlineNotification` containing an
  action or interactive children should be replaced with
  `ActionableNotification` configured with the `inline` prop.
- `children` can no longer contain interactive elements.
- The `notificationType` prop is no longer needed and can be removed.
- The default `role` is now `status`. `log` and `alert` can also be used.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

`ActionableNotification` config options:

- The `inline` prop enables a styling variation resulting in a similar visual
  design to `InlineNotification`.
- The `actionButtonLabel` prop configures the action button text.
- The `hasFocus` prop toggles the automatic placement of focus.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

### Toggle

The toggle component has been updated to improve its accessibility, rtl
compatibility and flexibility to layout.

- The underlying element has been changed from a checkbox
  (`<input type="checkbox">`) to a switch button (`<button role="switch">`).
  - `props.onChange` has been removed since it's not available on `<button>`
    elements.
  - `props.onClick` has been added to substitute the previous `onChange` event.
- `props['aria-label']` is no longer required.
  - `props.labelText` will always be available to screen readers without the use
    of `aria-label`.
  - If `props['aria-label']` is still passed, it will be emitted on the
    `<button>` element.
- `props.hideLabel` has been added. This hides `labelA` and `labelB` while
  moving `labelText` to the side for height-restricted layouts.
- `props.labelA` and `props.labelB` have been made optional and default to "Off"
  and "On" respectively.

## carbon-icons

The `carbon-icons` package has been deprecated and is no longer supported. To
use icons from the Carbon Design System, you should install the appropriate
library to use with your framework:

## @carbon/icons

**Changes**

- The `scss` directory which provided styles is no longer provided through this
  package

## @carbon/icons-react

The `@carbon/icons-react` package has been updated to minimize the number of
exports from the package to help reduce build and compile times.

This update includes a change to the API of the icon components that come from
this package. Previously, we would export icons that included the size of the
asset. This update allows you to bring the icon directly and specify the size
using the `size` prop.

**Before**

```jsx
import { Add32, Add24, Add20, Add16 } from '@carbon/icons-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Add32 />
      <Add24 />
      <Add20 />
      <Add16 />
    </>
  );
}
```

**After**

```jsx
import { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Add size={32} />
      <Add size={24} />
      <Add size={20} />
      <Add />
    </>
  );
}
```

_Note: by default, the `size` prop will point to the 16x16px version of the SVG
asset_

### Migration

Most use-cases of the icons from the `@carbon/icons-react` package will be
covered by an automated codemod. To run this codemod, follow the instructions
here: <TODO LINK>.

However, in certain situations, we will be unable to infer what the correct
update should be for a certain usage of the icon component. We have written the
codemod to work for most situations, but you will see console warnings for files
that will require you to manually review them to make sure the transforms were
applied correctly.

The most common manual update that teams will need to make is if a `prop` where
the icon is passed to places a `ref` on the icon. For example,

```jsx
function MyComponent({ renderIcon: Icon }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  return <Icon ref={ref} />;
}

// Before
<MyComponent renderIcon={Search16} />

// After the codemod
// TODO: This may be a bad transformation performance-wise
<MyComponent renderIcon={props => <Search size={16} {...props} />} />
```

In this situation, you will need to update your code to use `React.forwardRef`:

```jsx
<MyComponent
  renderIcon={React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
    <Search ref={ref} size={16} {...props} />
  ))}
/>;

// Or, alternatively:
const Search16 = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <Search ref={ref} size={16} {...props} />;
});

<MyComponent renderIcon={Search16} />;
```

### Manual migration

In addition to the automated codemods above, there are several patterns in your
codebase that you will need to update manually:

- If you use the name `ForwardRef(IconName16)` in a test you will need to
  manually change this. Prefer to use the component directly if using enzyme
- If you use snapshot tests, the structure will change and include a `size`
  prop. Make sure that the `size` prop value matches what your icon name used to
  be. For example, `<Add16 />` should become `<Add size={16} />`

#### Component definition is missing display name

If you use `eslint` you may run into the error message above. This comes from
the `react/display-rule` rule. It comes as a result of the transform changing
the following code:

```jsx
// Input
const iconTypes = {
  add: Add32,
};

// Output
const iconTypes = {
  add: (props) => <Add size={32} {...props} />,
};
```

The transform will create an inline arrow function expression and as a result it
does not have a `displayName` like if you created this function using a variable
or function declaration.

To address this issue, you can manually create the component:

```jsx
const Add32 = (props) => <Add size={32} {...props} />;
const iconTypes = {
  add: Add32,
};
```

## @carbon/motion

**Breaking changes**

- This package now requires Dart Sass and uses Sass Modules
- The `scss` folder is no longer needed, you can import `@carbon/motion`
  directly in Sass
- Variables, mixins, and functions using the `carbon--` prefix has been renamed
- Duration variables now have a `duration-` prefix

## @carbon/pictograms-react

## @carbon/themes

**Breaking changes**

- This package now requires Dart Sass and uses Sass Modules
- Variables, mixins, and functions with the `carbon--` prefix have been renamed
- Design Tokens have been changed, however you can use the
  [compatability guide](#todo) to use v10 tokens along with v11 tokens
- The `theme` mixin now emits CSS Custom Properties by default for the given
  theme, `$emit-custom-properties` and `$emit-difference` are no longer needed

### Design Tokens

**Status key:**

- **No change:** Token name has no change between versions.
- **Updated:** From v10 to V11 the number suffix has been replaced with an
  adjective that reflects it's usage. This is just a name change, the role
  remains the same between v10 and v11.
- **Split:** V10 token has been split into multiple new v11 tokens for more
  specific usage.
- **New:** A net new color token to the system in v11. It has no v10
  counterpart.
- **Deprecated:** v10 token was removed in v11.

### Compatability

To make it easier to move between v10 and v11 of Carbon, we've introduced a
compatability theme that includes the tokens from v10 and v11 so that you can
incrementally update your project.

You can use a "compatability theme" by setting the `$fallback` to a value from
`scss/compat/themes`. For example:

```scss
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/compat/themes' as compat;
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/themes';
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/theme' with (
  $fallback: compat.$g100,
  $theme: themes.$g100,
);
```

In this code snippet, we set the current theme to `$g100` and include the
compatability theme for `$g100` as the `$fallback.

## @carbon/type

**Breaking changes**

- This package now requires Dart Sass and uses Sass Modules
- The `scss` folder is no longer needed, you can import `@carbon/type` directly
  in Sass
- Variables, mixins, and functions with the `carbon--` prefix have been renamed

**Imports**

All imports in v11 have been replaced by `@carbon/type`. For example, if you
were importing `@carbon/type/scss/styles` in v10 you would now only import
`@carbon/type` and use exports from that module directly.

| v10                              | v11                                |
| :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `@import '@carbon/type/scss/*';` | `@use '@carbon/type';`             |
|                                  | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/type';` |
|                                  | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/type';`  |

## Type tokens

**Status key:**

- **No change:** Token name has no change between versions.
- **Updated:** This is just a name change, the role remains the same between v10
  and v11.
- **New:** A net new type token to the system in v11. It has no v10 counterpart.
- **Deprecated:** v10 token was removed in v11.
