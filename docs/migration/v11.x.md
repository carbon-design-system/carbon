| Date                        | Release          | Status            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Alpha release               | April 15th, 2021 | Published         |
| Beta release                | May 13th, 2021   | Under development |
| Release Candidate 0 release | June 10th, 2021  | Not published     |
| Stable release              | July 1st, 2021   | Not published     |

We are breaking up our v11 release into several iterations to get feedback from
teams before our stable release. If you're interested in helping us out with
this process, please go through our
[Release Partner Program](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/wiki/Release-Partner-Program)
to learn more about how to participate.

In general, all releases before the release candidate stage will be incomplete
or unstable. As we get closer to our stable release, we will cut release
candidates that will reflect our best approximation of v11 at the time of
publishing.

During each release stage, we're looking to get feedback from teams in our
[Release Partner Program](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/wiki/Release-Partner-Program).

## Previewing the release

There are two ways to try out the v11 release of Carbon:

- Feature flags along with the `carbon-components` and `carbon-components-react`
  packages
- Using the new packages directly, like `@carbon/react` or `@carbon/styles`

As we near the v11 release, the preference will be to use the `@carbon/react`
package. However, for the alpha and beta release, full compatibility will not be
available, so we recommend trying out new features using feature flags.

### Feature flags

Our team makes use of
[feature flags](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) to ship
new code in our v10 release without breaking existing usage.

To try out features related to the v11 release, you will use the
`enable-v11-release` flag in both Sass and JavaScript.

To enable this flag in `carbon-components`, you will need to set
`$feature-flags` before importing `carbon-components`. For example:

```scss
$feature-flags: (
  enable-v11-release: true,
);

@import 'path/to/carbon';
```

To enable this flag in `carbon-components-react`, you can either set flags
directly using the `@carbon/feature-flags` package or use the `FeatureFlags`
component.

**`FeatureFlags`**

```jsx
import { unstable_FeatureFlags as FeatureFlags } from 'carbon-components-react';

render(
  <FeatureFlags flags={{ 'enable-v11-release': true }}>
    <MyComponent />
  </FeatureFlags>
);
```

**`@carbon/feature-flags`**

First, create a file called `feature-flags.js` and include the following:

```js
import * as FeatureFlags from '@carbon/feature-flags';

FeatureFlags.enable('enable-v11-release');
```

Next, bring in this file as the first import in your project:

```js
import './feature-flags';

// Import feature flags before any of your application code
```
