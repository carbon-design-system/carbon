## Overview

The `carbon-components` package has moved to the `@carbon/styles` package
starting in v11. You can still access the latest v11 styles in
`carbon-components`, but it will be a re-export from `@carbon/styles`. This
package will be officially archived in v12.

Along with this change, the styles of Carbon have been completely updated to use
[Sass Modules](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-sass-modules/). This change
requires that teams use the [Dart Sass](https://npmjs.com/package/sass) package.
Support for `node-sass` has been dropped starting in v11.

This decision was made after seeing the
[deprecation notice](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) of
LibSass in late 2020.

With this change to Sass Modules, you'll find that many of the ways that you are
using Carbon today have been updated and streamlined. In general, most paths
have changed from the long form `scss/globals/scss/path/to/file` to simply
`scss/path/to/file`.

For example, to access the `theme` entrypoint you would have needed to import
`scss/globals/scss/theme`. Now, this entrypoint lives at `scss/theme`.

Alongside the updates to filepaths, you will find that helper mixins, functions,
and variables have been updated to no longer have a `carbon--` prefix. With Sass
Modules, the module name now serves as an appropriate prefix and provides
correct scoping.

For an overview of the changes corresponding to a file that you're currently
importing, checkout the [files](#files) table below. To learn more about how to
use `@carbon/styles` and the new Sass Module system, we recommend checking out
the project [`README.md`](../../packages/styles/README.md).

There are two major areas of changes in the package, namely:

- [`scss/globals/scss`](#scssglobalsscss)
- [`scss/components/`](#scsscomponents)

## `scss/globals/scss`

The majority of the files currently available under `/scss/globals/scss` are now
available under `/scss` directory, or through our new utilities folder in
`/scss/utilties`.

Below, you'll find an overview of files that are a part of our Public API and
where they have moved to in v11. Each row also contains a link to a section
below that goes over any API changes for the file.

### `scss/globals/scss/styles.scss`

| v10                                                          | v11                      |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';` | `@use '@carbon/styles';` |

The `styles.scss` entrypoint was provided as a way to bring in all of the styles
for the Carbon Design System. In v11, this is available through
`@carbon/styles/index.scss` which can be directly imported with `@use` by
writing out:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles';
```

If you are overriding different settings of the project, like `$prefix`, you
will need to pass those into the `with` block in the import:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles' with (
  $prefix: 'cds',
);
```

For a full overview of changes to how you configure Carbon, checkout our
[configuration](#configuration) section below.

### `scss/globals/scss/_colors.scss`

| v10                                                     | v11                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/colors';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/colors';` |

The `scss/globals/scss/_colors.scss` entrypoint provided a re-export of the
`@carbon/colors` package. This entrypoint now lives at `scss/_colors.scss` in
`@carbon/styles` and can be included by writing:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/colors';

.example {
  color: colors.$blue-50;
}
```

The following is a list of API changes in v11 for `@carbon/colors` that are
present in `@carbon/styles/scss/colors`:

| v10                     | v11                            |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `$ibm-*` variables      | Removed                        |
| `$carbon-*` variables   | Removed                        |
| `$ibm-color-map`        | Removed                        |
| `$carbon--colors`       | Removed, replaced by `$colors` |
| `@mixin ibm--colors`    | Removed                        |
| `@mixin carbon--colors` | Removed                        |

### `scss/globals/scss/_css--body.scss`

TODO

### `scss/globals/scss/_css--font-face.scss`

Beginning in V11, the `@ibm/plex` package will be included as a dependency of
`@carbon/styles`. Because of this, we will no longer be serving the files via
Google Fonts. You will get the fonts by default by importing from the main
entrypoint (`@use '@carbon/styles'`), or by referencing the font face file
directly (`@use '@carbon/styles/scss/font-face'`). If you are already hosting
the font files, and do not want the font files to be emitted, you can set the
`$css--font-face` variable to `false`.

### `scss/globals/scss/_css--helpers.scss`

The `scss/globals/scss/_css--helpers` entrypoint provides class-based helpers
when the `$css--helpers` flag is set to true, specifically:

- `bx--assistive-text` and `bx--visually-hidden`
- `bx--body`

In v11, the assistive text and visually hidden classes are now available under:
`scss/utilities/_visually-hidden`.

TODO `bx--body`

### `scss/globals/scss/_css--reset.scss`

| v10                                                         | v11                                 |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/css--reset';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/reset';` |

The `scss/globals/scss/css--reset` entrypoint is used for including a CSS reset
in a project using Carbon. It is configurable using the `$css--reset` global
flag.

In v11, this entrypoint is now available at `scss/reset` and is still
configurable with the `$css--reset` configuration option. By default,
`$css--reset` is set to `true`.

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/config' with (
  $css--reset: true,
);
@use '`@carbon/styles/scss/reset';
```

### `scss/globals/scss/_helper-classes.scss`

The `scss/globals/scss/_helper-classes.scss` entrypoint was used to emit CSS
classes for text truncation, specifically:

- `bx--text-truncate--end`
- `bx--text-truncate--front`

TODO

### `scss/globals/scss/_helper-mixins.scss`

The `scss/globals/scss/_helper-mixins.scss` entrypoint exported a number of
helper mixins that could be used when building components. In v11, these helpers
have been moved to utilities located under `scss/utilities/`. Below is a table
that details to which files a particular helper has been moved.

| v10                         | v11                                       |

| `@mixin box-shadow`         | `scss/utilities/_box-shadow.scss`         |
| `@mixin focus-outline`      | `scss/utilities/_focus-outline.scss`      |
| `@mixin rotate`             | `scss/utilities/_rotate.scss`             |
| `@mixin hidden`             | TODO                                      |
| `@mixin button-reset`       | `scss/utilities/_button-reset.scss`       |
| `@mixin skeleton`           | `scss/utilities/_skeleton.scss`           |
| `@keyframes skeleton`       | `scss/utilities/_keyframes.scss` TODO     |
| `@mixin high-contrast-mode` | `scss/utilities/_high-contrast-mode.scss` |

### `scss/globals/scss/_layout.scss`

TODO

### `scss/globals/scss/_mixins.scss`

The `scss/globals/scss/_mixins.scss` entrypoint re-exported mixins from the
following files:

- `scss/globals/scss/helper-mixins`
- `scss/components/button/mixins`;
- `scss/components/loading/mixins`;
- `scss/components/notification/mixins`;
- `scss/components/tag/mixins`;
- `scss/components/structured-list/mixins`;

In v11, this entrypoint has been removed. If you are using a mixin from this
entrypoint, find the appropriate mixin from the migration guidance for one of
the files above.

TODO: anything else we can offer for guidance here?

### `scss/globals/scss/_motion.scss`

| v10                                                     | v11                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/motion';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/motion';` |

The `scss/globals/scss/_motion.scss` entrypoint re-exported exports from the
`@carbon/motion` package along with providing a number of helpers and variables
for duration and easing curves.

| v10                        | v11                     |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `$carbon--ease-in`         | Removed                 |
| `$carbon--ease-out`        | Removed                 |
| `$carbon--standard-easing` | Removed                 |
| `$transition--base`        | Removed                 |
| `$transition--expansion`   | Removed                 |
| `$duration--fast-01`       | `$duration-fast-01`     |
| `$duration--fast-02`       | `$duartion-fast-02`     |
| `$duration--moderate-01`   | `$duration-moderate-01` |
| `$duration--moderate-02`   | `$duration-moderate-01` |
| `$duration--slow-01`       | `$duration-slow-01`     |
| `$duration--slow-02`       | `$duration-slow-02`     |
| `@function motion`         | No changes              |
| `@mixin motion`            | No changes              |

TODO what to use instead of removed items?

[API documentation](../../packages/motion/docs/sass.md#todo) for the
`@carbon/motion` package.

### `scss/globals/scss/_spacing.scss`

| v10                                                      | v11                                   |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/spacing';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/spacing';` |

The `scss/globals/scss/_spacing.scss` entrypoint provided a number of variables
for spacing and include re-exports from the `@carbon/layout` package for
`mini-unit` support as well as the spacing scale.

In v11, this entrypoint has been moved to `scss/_spacing.scss` and a number of
exports have been changed.

| v10                            | v11                                  |

| :----------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/theme';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme';` |

The `scss/globals/scss/_theme.scss` entrypoint re-exported tokens from the
`_theme-tokens.scss` entrypoint. In v11, you can import this file directly and
reference the current theme, tokens defined in the theme, as well as dynamically
retrieve the current value of a token.

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme';

.example {
  background: theme.$background;
  color: theme.$text-primary;
}
```

exports from `@carbon/type`.

In v11, this entrypoint has been moved to `scss/_type.scss` and several of its
exports have changed or removed.

### `scss/globals/scss/_vars.scss`

The `scss/globals/scss/_vars.scss` entrypoint was used to access most of the
public variables from the Carbon Design System. It also specified the `$prefix`
used for CSS.examples in the codebase.

In v11, this file has been removed. To get access to variables that you
previously were using `_vars.scss` for, you will need to find the correct direct
import. For changing the `$prefix` used in the project, you can configure this
through the `scss/_config.scss` entrypoint.

For more information about configuring the project, check out the
[configuration](#configuration) section below.

### `scss/globals/grid/_grid.scss`

| v10                                                   | v11                                |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/grid/grid';` | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/grid';` |

The `scss/globals/grid/_grid.scss` entrypoint provides access to the flexbox
based grid from the `@carbon/grid` package.

In v11, this entrypoint has been moved to `scss/_grid.scss` and continues to
re-export from the `@carbon/grid` package. In addition, the default grid has
been changed from the 12 column variant to the 16 column grid.

_Note: if you're using `$feature-flags` to set `grid-columns-16` you can remove
this flag in v11_

Finally, our default grid implementation no longer uses flexbox. Instead, it
uses CSS Grid. For more information about these changes, checkout [todo](#todo).

| v10                         | v11 |
| :-------------------------- | :-- |
| `@mixin grid`               |     |
| `@mixin carbon--grid`       |     |
| `$carbon--12-column-grid`   |     |
| `$carbon--grid-breakpoints` |     |

## `scss/components`

The components located under `scss/components` are available under
`scss/components/<component>/_<component>.scss`. For example, to import an
accordion:

```scss
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/accordion/accordion';
```

In v11, these files now live at `scss/components/<component>/_index.scss` and
can be shortened to `scss/components/<component>` since Dart Sass resolves
`_index.scss` files automatically. for example:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/accordion';
```

## Configuration

In v10, you could configure various aspects of Carbon using global flags that
were set before including Carbon. For example, you could change the prefix used
or disable the CSS reset that the project used by doing the following:

```scss
$prefix: 'cds';
$css--reset: false;

@import 'path/to/carbon';
```

Similarly, you could enable or disable `$feature-flags` for the project with a
similar approach.

This approach no longer works with the project's switch to Sass Modules.
Instead, you will need to configure Carbon through the `scss/_config.scss`
entrypoint using `with`. This file is re-exported in various entrypoints, so you
can configure Carbon on the main entrypoint:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles' with (
  $prefix: 'cds',
);
```

Or you can configure the `scss/_config.scss` directly:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/config' with (
  $prefix: 'cds',
);
```

_Note: Sass modules can only ever be configured once. Bringing in this module
and configuring it should be one of the first things you do in your project._

The following is a table of configuration options and their status in v11. Ones
that are available you can configure through the `scss/_config.scss` entrypoint,
ones that are removed are no longer available.
