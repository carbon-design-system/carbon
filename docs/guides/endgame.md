## About

Inspired by the release process of
[VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Development-Process#end-game),
Carbon follows a release process that we refer to as the endgame. Given that our
work is structured in a series of projects across an iteration, the endgame is
an opportunity in the final week of an iteration for us to coordinate final
deliverables, run verification testing, and lean on the Carbon community to help
verify pre-release builds.

### Meet the endgame team

Every release cycle, we have three team members participate in running the
endgame in addition to their project-specific responsibilities. Running the
endgame involves a variety of tasks outlined in our [timeline](#timeline). This
endgame team is composed of a release leader, and two sidekicks. There should be
at minimum one designer and one developer in each endgame team.

The objectives of the release leader include the following:

- Coordinate the initial project proposals into a single iteration cycle
  planning issue that is shared in our issue tracker
- Share through an external blog the top-level objectives of the projects we're
  working for a given cycle
- Help coordinate across projects throughout the project cycle in order to run a
  successful endgame
- Help to familiarize sidekicks with the endgame process so each of them may run
  a future endgame
- Successfully run the endgame at the conclusion of a release cycle

The objectives of the release sidekicks include:

- Assisting the release leader in endgame tasks at the end of the release cycle
- Creating documentation to make the onboarding process easier for future
  sidekicks
- Learning and understanding how to run a future endgame process

After a release cycle completes, the endgame team will be reorganized. The
endgame leader will become a sidekick to help out with the release, and one of
the sidekicks will become the new endgame leader. New team members will fill in
the remaining sidekick role over time.

At a high-level, this sequence might look like the following:

Given the team:

- A (Developer)
- B (Developer)
- C (Designer)
- D (Designer)
- E (Developer)

|            | Leader        | Sidekick 1    | Sidekick 2    |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Rotation 1 | A (Developer) | B (Developer) | C (Designer)  |
| Rotation 2 | B (Developer) | C (Designer)  | A (Developer) |
| Rotation 3 | C (Designer)  | D (Developer) | B (Developer) |
| Rotation 4 | D (Developer) | E (Designer)  | C (Designer)  |
| Rotation 5 | E (Designer)  | A (Developer) | D (Developer) |

## Timeline

Release cycles tend to last between four and six weeks. During that time, the
endgame team is responsible for the following high-level milestones:

- [Week 1: Project kickoff](#week-1-project-kickoff)
- [Week 2: Project work](#week-2-project-work)

## Releases

As part of the endgame process, the endgame team will faciliate the following
types of releases:

| Release type                                     | Description                                                             | Semver bump | Frequency                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| [Hotfix](#hotfix-releases)                       | Fix severity level 1 issues with large user-facing impact               | `patch`     | On demand                                          |
| [Patch](#patch-releases)                         | Batched fixes to packages with varying degrees of severity and priority | `patch`     | Weekly                                             |
| [Release candidate](#release-candidate-releases) | Features and fixes that will be included in minor release               | `preminor`  | Typically 6 weeks, as needed before minor release  |
| [Minor](#minor-releases)                         | Features and fixes to packages                                          | `minor`     | Typically 6 weeks, occasionally on-demand          |
| [Major](#major-releases)                         | Large or semver-incompatible changes to the design system               | `major`     | Typically 6 months to 1 year, announced in advance |

The Carbon team distributes these releases under two channels:

<!--
Inspiration for copy and terminology comes from Google Chrome:
https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9027636?hl=en
-->

- Nightly
  - Users on the Nightly channel get a 4 to 6 week preview of what's coming to
    the Stable version of the Carbon Design System
  - The Nightly channel is updated daily and includes features and fixes the day
    after they're merged into the codebase
  - Users on the Nightly channel can discover possible issues with a release,
    giving you time to address the issues before the release is rolled into the
    Stable channel
  - Users on the Nightly channel may discover issues with the release and are
    priority support to help resolve those issues
- Stable
  - The Stable channel is fully tested by the Carbon Design System team and
    should be used by most product teams
  - This channel is updated weekly for `patch` releases (when applicable), and
    every 4 to 6 weeks for `minor` releases

### Hotfix releases

A hotfix release is triggered by a bugfix that was introduced into the codebase
that was high severity (2 or higher) and includes any of the following criteria:

- Impacts a large number of product-facing users
  - An example of this would be that a component is rendered in-operable
- Impacts a large number of direct consumers
  - An example of this would be that a broken package build was published

Hotfixes are published under the `patch` semver range and can be published at
any point in the endgame process.

#### Publishing steps

Same as patch release steps.

### Patch releases

A patch release is scheduled as a weekly update to batch bug fixes to the
project. It can also be created on-demand outside of this weekly schedule,
although these situations should be uncommon.

A `patch` release will contain changes to the codebase that fall under the
following categories:

- A bug fix to an existing piece of code
- Content or documentation updates
- Refactoring of existing code while supporting the same public API and not
  changing in behavior

The release may contain other types of software changes, however the one type of
update that is not shipped is the addition of functionality that does not
already exist in the project. These updates are reserved for
[minor releases](#minor-releases).

#### Publishing steps - Manual Instructions

All patches are based on the previous stable git tag. You can find the latest
git tag by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git tag -l --sort=-v:refname
```

The first tag you see at the top of the screen will be the latest tag. In
addition, you can use the GitHub UI to view the
[latest release](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/releases/latest).
The git tag associated with the latest release will be the one you'll want to
use.

You can checkout git tags using `git` by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout <name-of-tag>
```

For example:

```bash
git checkout v10.4.0
```

You should then create a branch off of this tag that will include that changes
for the next patch release. You should name this branch using the following
pattern: `chore/release-vX.Y.Z`. The version should be one patch bump higher
than the last stable git tag. For example:

- `v10.4.0` becomes `v10.4.1`
- `v10.4.1` becomes `v10.4.2`

If the last stable git tag was `v10.4.0`, then the branch would be named:

```bash
git checkout -b chore/release-v10.4.1
```

After creating this branch, your goal will be use the
[`cherry-pick`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) feature from `git` to
bring over commits with the following types:

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- fix
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

The most important commit type we do not want to bring over is `feat`, as this
would be a [`minor`](#minor-releases) release.

The list of commits that you will want to cherry-pick over will come from
comparing the latest tag to `master`. You can do this through GitHub UI using a
URl with this structure:

```http
https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/compare/vX.Y.Z...vA.B.C
```

For example, if I wanted to compare `v10.4.1` to `v10.4.0`, the URL would look
like:

```http
https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/compare/v10.4.0...v10.4.1
```

To compare what is in `master` to the latest tag, this would look like:

```http
https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/compare/v10.4.1...master
```

You can replace the latest git tag with the `v10.4.1` tag in the above URL to
see all the changes that have been merged into `master` since the last git tag
was published.

From this list, you should look for commits that begin the valid types detailed
above. For each commit you would like you cherry-pick, you should copy the seven
character commit hash found at the end of each line in the compare view (on the
far right-hand side). You can then use this information using `git cherry-pick`
by doing:

```bash
git cherry-pick <HASH>
```

For example:

```bash
git cherry-pick 954ac48
```

If you notice that multiple commits in succession have valid types, you can
cherry-pick a range of commits by using the `..` characters between two commit
hashes, where the first hash is the first commit in the range and the second
hash is the last commit in the range. In practice, this looks like:

```bash
git cherry-pick 954ac48..688c8d2
```

_Note: if you run into a commit that is unstructured (it totally happens, no
sweat!) try and determine whether the commit is patch-related, or not._

If you run into a merge conflict, try and determine the root cause. If it's
related to a generated file, feel free to regenerate, commit, and continue. If
it's related to code, this will require a broader look to figure out what's
going on. Worst-case, we can always cut a minor release from the latest `master`
if an appropriate patch could not be generated.

Once you are done cherry-picking commits, it's time to version the changed
packages.

_Note: If you don't have an npm account, you'll need to go to
https://www.npmjs.com/signup to create one. Once you've created the account,
find a team member who can give you permission to publish to the Carbon
packages. It may take a couple of hours for npm to recognize the permission
change. You will also need to login into npm from your terminal using the
command `npm adduser`, where you will be prompted for your username and
password._

You can use `lerna` to version the changed packages by running:

```bash
yarn lerna version patch --no-push --no-git-tag-version --exact
```

You should see a confirmation dialog similar to the following:

```bash
Changes:
 - carbon-components: 10.4.1 => 10.4.2
 - @carbon/elements: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1
 - @carbon/icons-angular: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1
 - @carbon/icons-handlebars: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1
 - @carbon/icons-react: 10.4.1 => 10.4.2
 - @carbon/icons-vue: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1
 - @carbon/icons: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1
 - carbon-components-react: 7.4.1 => 7.4.2
 - @carbon/sketch: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1 (private)

? Are you sure you want to create these versions? (ynH)
```

You should inspect the list of changed packages to make sure they align with the
commits you cherry-picked over. If something looks off, feel free to stop this
command and figure out what is going on before starting again.

If everything looks good, you can enter in `y` for `Yes` and `lerna` will handle
versioning the corresponding packages. If you run `git status`, you should see
that `package.json` files have been updated for the corresponding packages
above. You should commit these changes on your branch with the commit message:

```bash
git commit -m 'chore(release): update package versions'
```

Once that's done, you should create a Pull Request in Draft state and make sure
**not** to merge it. Our goal with the Pull Request is to do a check for CI
checks, verify preview links work as expected, and get final reviews from the
endgame team for the release. For this Pull Request, you'll want to generate a
changelog for the reviewers. To do this, create a tag for the version you'll
release and push it to upstream by running:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
git push upstream vX.Y.Z
```

For example, if you released `v10.6.4`:

```bash
git tag -a v10.6.4 -m "v10.6.4"
git push upstream v10.6.4
```

In your terminal, generate the changelog for the tag by running the following
command in your PR branch:

```bash
./packages/cli/bin/carbon-cli.js changelog <previous-tag>..<latest-tag>
```

For example, to get the changelog for `v10.6.4` run:

```bash
./packages/cli/bin/carbon-cli.js changelog v10.6.3..v10.6.4
```

Say yes to the prompt to copy the changelog to your clipboard and paste it into
the Pull Request description. Reviewers should make sure that the changes in the
changelog match the changes listed at
https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/compare/vX.Y.Z...vA.B.C, updated
with the appropriate version numbers for the version you are creating.

Once everything is green and your Pull Request has been reviewed, you should
**close** the draft Pull Request. On your machine, you should then follow the
following steps to release:

- Run the following steps to make sure
  [your environment is consistent with `upstream`](#making-sure-your-environment-is-consistent-with-upstream)
- In your PR branch, run `yarn lerna publish from-package --dist-tag next` to
  publish all packages under the `next` tag
- You should run the smoke tests that we have listed [here](#smoke-tests) with
  the published packages
- If everything looks good to go, then you should go through each of the
  packages and add the `latest` tag using the command:
  `npm dist-tag add package-name@X.Y.Z latest`
- Find the tag you created earlier under the
  [Releases](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/releases) tab. Then
  ,click on the tag link and select `Edit tag` on the top right corner. Add in
  the changelog you created earlier to the description and update the title with
  the tag name and publish the release!

<details>
   <summary>`Automatated process instructions`</summary>

1. From the root of your directory, checkout the latest tag. You can checkout
   git tags using `git` by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git checkout <name-of-tag>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   git checkout v10.4.0
   ```

2. Run `./packages/cli/bin/carbon-cli.js release patch` **_Note: Currently, the
   CLI command isn't working. See the manual instructions for the patch release.
   process_**

   - You will see the terminal do a few things: get the latest tag, find the
     next version to bump, create a branch for the release, and begin
     cherry-picking PRs. The most important thing to note when cherry-picking
     PRs is that we do not want to bring over `feat`, as this would be a
     breaking change for a [`minor`](#minor-releases) release.

   - If the PR commit does not follow commit syntax, the terminal will prompt
     you something similar to:

     ```bash
     ? Should we include commit: 2953c461a Non-commit syntax message here
     ```

     Type `y` to include it in the patch release or `n` to exclude it. If it's
     not clear right off the bat, you can find the merged PR by its number and
     look through it to see if it includes new features or not.

   - If you get a prompt that says:
     ```bash
     ? Applying the commit XXXXXX lead to a conflict. Please fix the conflict and then confirm to proceed. (y/N)
     ```
     Open a new tab in your terminal. You can view the changes by running
     `git status`. Run `git add -A`. Then run `git cherry-pick --continue`. Once
     you see that the changes have been committed, go back to your original
     terminal tab, where we are releasing. Type `y` in response to the prompt
     and continue.
   - If you get an error because a commit message is too long, run
     `git commit --no-verify`

3. Once the commits have been cherry-picked, you'll be prompted with something
   like:

   ```bash
   Changes:
    - carbon-components: 10.4.1 => 10.4.2
    - @carbon/elements: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1
    - @carbon/icons-angular: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1
    - @carbon/icons-handlebars: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1
    - @carbon/icons-react: 10.4.1 => 10.4.2
    - @carbon/icons-vue: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1
    - @carbon/icons: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1
    - carbon-components-react: 7.4.1 => 7.4.2
    - @carbon/sketch: 10.4.0 => 10.4.1 (private)

   ? Are you sure you want to create these versions? (ynH)
   ```

   You should inspect the list of changed packages to make sure they align with
   the commits you cherry-picked over. If something looks off, feel free to stop
   this command and figure out what is going on before starting again.

   If everything looks good, you can enter in `y` for `Yes` and `lerna` will
   handle versioning the corresponding packages.

4. Once that's done, you should create a Pull Request in Draft state and make
   sure **not** to merge it. Our goal with the Pull Request is to do a final
   check for CI checks, verify preview links work as expected, and get final
   reviews from the endgame team for the release. _Note: Make sure to specify
   which packages are being updated for your reviewers._

5. Once everything is green, review the pull request. Make sure there are no
   commits labeled `feat` as the patch release should only be for bug fixes,
   content updates, or refactoring existing code. Double check that the
   `package.json` versions are updated correctly by verifying the green
   (updated) version numbers are an incremental increase to the red (deleted)
   version numbers. If everything is correct, **close** the draft Pull Request.

6. On your machine, you should then follow the following steps to publish to
   `next`:

   - From your **PR branch**, run
     `yarn lerna publish from-package --dist-tag next` to publish all packages
     under the `next` tag
   - After publishing to `next`, run the smoke tests that we have listed
     [here](#testing) with the published packages

7. If everything looks good to go add each of the updated packages to the
   `latest` tag by running the following command for each:

   ```bash
   npm dist-tag add package-name@X.Y.Z latest
   ```

   For example, if you released `10.6.1` under `next`, this would look like:

   ```bash
   npm dist-tag add carbon-components@10.6.1 latest
   ```

8. Manually check to see that the `latest` tags were updated for the packages
   correctly by going to [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com), searching the packages,
   viewing the versions and making sure the `latest` version matches the version
   you released.

9. After publishing to latest, create a tag for the version you released and
   push it to upstream by running:

   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
   git push upstream vX.Y.Z
   ```

   For example, if you released `v10.6.4`:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v10.6.4 -m "v10.6.4"
   git push upstream v10.6.4
   ```

10. When the tag has been added to upstream, find it under the
    [Releases](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/releases) tab.
    Then, click on the tag link and select `Edit tag` on the top right corner.
    In your terminal, generate the changelog for the tag by running the
    following command from your PR branch:

    ```bash
    ./packages/cli/bin/carbon-cli.js changelog <previous-tag>..<latest-tag>
    ```

    For example, to get the changelog for `v10.6.4` run:

    ```bash
    ./packages/cli/bin/carbon-cli.js changelog v10.6.3..v10.6.4
    ```

    Once the changelog has been copied to your clipboard, paste it in the tag
    description in your browser. Set the title to the release version, and
    publish the release.

### Release candidate releases

​ Before our minor releases, we cut release candidates a week in advance to
check our code. ​

#### Publishing steps

1. Checkout `master`, and pull the latest upstream
2. Create a branch for your release candidate PR following the convention
   `chore/release-vX.Y.Z-rc.X`. For example, if we’re cutting the first RC for
   `v10.6` the branch would be `chore/release-v10.6.0-rc.0`, the second RC would
   be `chore/release-v10.6.0-rc.1` and so on.
3. Once you’ve created the branch, run
   `yarn lerna version preminor --exact --preid rc --no-push --no-git-tag-version -m 'chore(release): update package versions'`
4. Open a PR with the changes, and merge after approval.
5. Once the PR is merged, run the following scripts from `master` to publish the
   RC under the `next` tag: ​

   ```
   yarn clean
   yarn install --offline
   yarn build
   yarn lerna publish from-package --dist-tag next
   ```

6. Manually check to see that the `next` tag was updated for the packages
   correctly by going to [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com), searching the packages,
   viewing the versions and making sure the `next` version matches the version
   you released.

### Minor releases

A minor release represents the addition of functionality and bug fixes to the
codebase. Typically, they are released on a 4 to 6 week cadence. However, they
can be released on-demand in specific circumstances.

#### Publishing steps

1. Checkout `master`, and pull the latest upstream
2. From the root directory, run `./packages/cli/bin/carbon-cli.js release minor`

   - This will checkout the latest tag, find the next version for you to bump,
     create a new branch for your release, and reset your project state before
     prompting you to create the next version.
   - You should see a confirmation dialog similar to the following:

     ```bash
     Changes:
      - carbon-components: 10.5.0 => 10.6.0
      - @carbon/elements: 10.5.0 => 10.6.0
      - @carbon/icons-angular: 10.5.0 => 10.6.0
      - @carbon/icons-handlebars: 10.5.0 => 10.6.0
      - @carbon/icons-react: 10.5.0 => 10.6.0
      - @carbon/icons-vue: 10.5.0 => 10.6.0
      - @carbon/icons: 10.5.0 => 10.6.0
      - carbon-components-react: 7.5.0 => 7.6.0
      - @carbon/sketch: 10.5.0 => 10.6.0 (private)

     ? Are you sure you want to create these versions? (ynH)
     ```

   - If everything looks good, you can enter in `y` for `Yes` and `lerna` will
     handle versioning the corresponding packages.

3. After the package versions have been created, you'll be prompted
   `The next step will be to manually create a Pull Request for this branch`.
   Push your changes and open the PR. Be sure your commit message reads
   `chore(release): update package versions`
4. Once your PR is approved and merged, checkout `master`, pull the latest
   upstream and run:

   ```
   yarn clean
   yarn install --offline
   yarn build
   ```

5. Then, update `next` by running
   `./packages/cli/bin/carbon-cli.js publish vX.Y.Z`.

6. At the end, the terminal will print out raw markdown for the changelog. Copy
   the markdown, and update the
   [release](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/releases) changelog
   for the version. Make sure the title matches the existing tag, `vX.Y.Z`.
7. Manually check to see that the `next` tag was updated for the packages
   correctly by going to [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com), searching the packages,
   viewing the versions and making sure the `next` version matches the version
   you released.

8. When you're ready to update `latest`, run
   `npm dist-tag add package-name@X.Y.Z latest` for each of the updated
   packages. For example, when releasing `10.6`, this would look like:

   ```bash
   npm dist-tag add carbon-components@10.6.0 latest
   npm dist-tag add carbon-components-react@7.6.0 latest
   npm dist-tag add @carbon/elements@10.6.0 latest
   npm dist-tag add @carbon/grid@10.6.0 latest
   npm dist-tag add @carbon/icons-handlebars@10.6.0 latest
   npm dist-tag add @carbon/icons-react@10.6.0 latest
   npm dist-tag add @carbon/icons-vue@10.6.0 latest
   npm dist-tag add @carbon/icons@10.6.0 latest
   npm dist-tag add @carbon/layout@10.5.0 latest
   npm dist-tag add @carbon/type@10.5.0 latest
   npm dist-tag add @carbon/themes@10.6.0 latest
   ```

9. Like before, manually check to see that the `latest` tags were updated for
   the packages correctly by going to [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com), searching
   the packages, viewing the versions and making sure the `latest` version
   matches the version you released.

10. After publishing to latest, create a tag for the version you released and
    push it to upstream by running:

    ```bash
    git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
    git push upstream vX.Y.Z
    ```

    For example, if you released `v10.6.0`:

    ```bash
    git tag -a v10.6.0 -m "v10.6.0"
    git push upstream v10.6.0
    ```

11. When the tag has been added to upstream, find it under the
    [Releases](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/releases) tab.
    Then, click on the tag link and select `Edit tag` on the top right corner.
    In your terminal, generate the changelog for the tag by running the
    following command in your PR branch:

    ```bash
    ./packages/cli/bin/carbon-cli.js changelog <previous-tag>..<latest-tag>
    ```

    For example, to get the changelog for `v10.6.0` run:

    ```bash
    ./packages/cli/bin/carbon-cli.js changelog v10.5.3..v10.6.0
    ```

    Once the changelog has been copied to your clipboard, paste it in the tag
    description in your browser. Set the title to the release version, and
    publish the release.

### Major releases

A major release represents the addition of semver-incompatible changes to the
project, and are only expected to occur every 6 months to a year. These releases
will be announced in advance, and migration strategies and support will be made
available to assist in transitioning between versions.

#### Publishing steps

## Testing

Before shipping a release of the Carbon Design System, we need to run through
the following testing scenarios:

- [ ] Trigger update for release under our own projects, namely:
  - [ ] `carbon-website`
  - [ ] `gatsby-theme-carbon`
- [ ] React smoke tests
  - [ ] `create-react-app`

<details>
  <summary>How to run React smoke test</summary>

Change directories to wherever you want to add the project and run:

```bash
npx create-react-app tmp
```

Change directories so you're in the newly created `tmp` folder and run `yarn` in
your terminal.

After that is done, install the dependencies: carbon-components,
carbon-components-react, carbon-icons and node-sass (two dependencies that the
other packages require) by running:

```bash
yarn add carbon-components@next carbon-components-react@next @carbon/icons-react node-sass
// And
yarn add node-sass
```

Once that's done, open up `tmp` in your code editor and rename `index.css` to
`index.scss` and add:

```javascript
@import '~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';
```

to the top of `index.scss`.

Update the `index.css` import to `index.scss` in `index.js`. At the top of
`App.js`, import the `Button` component by adding the following:

```js
import { Button } from 'carbon-components-react';
```

In the `App` component return, add the `Button` and then run `yarn start` and
verify that the `Button` looks correct and no erros are logged to the console.
