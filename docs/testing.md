## End-to-end

We use our end-to-end tests to verify the packaging of libraries along with the
look and behavior of components in our design system. End-to-end tests for
packages are run using Jest, components are run using Playwright.

### Playwright

We use Playwright to run end-to-end tests against our components in our Design
System. We also use it in other situations to prevent visual regressions, like
in our elements site.

These tests are authored within the `e2e` directory and match the file pattern:
`*-test.e2e.js`.

#### Developing

When working with Playwright locally, it's important to start up the service
that you're testing against. For components in React, this will mean starting up
the React storybook locally by doing the following from the root of the project:

```bash
cd packages/react
yarn storybook
```

One the storybook is loaded, you can run tests against is using the storybook
test-utils found in `e2e/test-utils/storybook`. A common use-case for testing a
component is to use Percy to take a snapshot of a component in a particular
theme from a specific story in storybook.

You can do this by writing the following:

```js
// e2e/components/component/component-test.e2e.js

'use strict';

const { test } = require('@playwright/test');
const { themes } = require('../../test-utils/env');
const { snapshotStory } = require('../../test-utils/storybook');

test('component-name @vrt', ({ page }) => {
  await snapshotStory(page, {
    component: 'component',
    story: 'story-name',
    theme: 'white',
  });
});
```

You can test this component in multiple themes by writing the following:

```js
// e2e/components/component/component-test.e2e.js

'use strict';

const { test } = require('@playwright/test');
const { themes } = require('../../test-utils/env');
const { snapshotStory } = require('../../test-utils/storybook');

test.describe('component-name @vrt', () => {
  themes.forEach((theme) => {
    test(theme, async ({ page }) => {
      await snapshotStory(page, {
        component: 'component',
        story: 'story-name',
        theme,
      });
    });
  });
});
```

If you would like to debug or interact with the test suite, you can use
Playwright's VS Code integration or run `yarn playwright test` with the
`--debug` flag to open up the inspector. This will allow you to go through the
test step-by-step to debug what's going on. It will also allow you to interact
with the page to quickly find selectors you can use to find items to run tests
against.

#### Working with snapshots locally

Sometimes you'll want to debug snapshots locally instead of relying on an
externaly service to get feedback. To do so, you can use the
`ENABLE_LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS` environment variable to store snapshots locally. Almost
any playwright command you run can be prefixed with this value in order to store
screenshots locally.

```bash
ENABLE_LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS=1 yarn playwright test --project chromium --grep @vrt component-test.e2e.js
```

**Note: it's important to narrow down tests in order to not generate a lot of
screenshots locally**

The first time you'll run this command, it will need to generate the baseline
snapshots for this component. The second time you run it, it will compare the
snapshots for the current page with what is stored in the screenshot. If the two
do not match, playwright will report a failure and will provide a link to the
diff image on your machine.

## FAQ

### Why am I seeing `browserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at ../path`?

The browser executables need to be installed so that playwright can run tests
inside chromium, firefox, etc. They can be installed by running
`yarn playwright install`
