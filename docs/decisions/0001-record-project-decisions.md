# 1. Record project decisions

Date: 2025-06-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the Carbon Design System has evolved over time, the context and reasoning
surrounding many decisions has been lost.

We need to record the high level decisions made on this project to preserve this
chain of history for ourselves and future maintainers.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in
this article:

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
