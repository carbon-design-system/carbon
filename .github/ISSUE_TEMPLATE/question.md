Hi there! 👋 Hope everything is going okay using projects from the Carbon Design
System. It looks like you might have a question about our work, so we wanted to
share a couple resources that you could use if you haven't tried them yet 🙂.

If you're an IBMer, we have a couple of Slack channels available across all IBM
Workspaces:

- #carbon-design-system for questions about the Design System
- #carbon-components for questions about component styles
- #carbon-react for questions about our React components

If these resources don't work out, help us out by filling out a couple of
details below!
