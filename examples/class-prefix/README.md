This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Class Prefix

By default, the prefix used by components is cds. However, you can change this
prefix in Sass and coordinate that change to React using the ClassPrefix
component.

## Getting Started

First, run `yarn build` in the root of the `carbon` repository.

```sh
yarn install && yarn build
```

Now, all you need to do is `cd` into the directory and run:

```sh
yarn install
# or
npm install


yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the
result.

## Sass

First and foremost, if you want to use v11 styles in any capacity, you'll have
to migrate to use `dart-sass`. `node-sass` has been deprecated and we migrated
to `dart-sass` in v11. For more information about migrating, visit our docs
[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#changing-from-node-sass-to-sass).

In Sass, you can customize this prefix by writing the following:

`@use '@carbon/react' with ( $prefix: 'custom' );`

Similarly, you can configure scss/config directly:

`@use '@carbon/react/scss/config' with ( $prefix: 'custom' );`

## V11

This example is of how to use ClassPrefix from v11 ðŸŽ‰.
