This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Id Prefix

This component is intended to be used in limited cases, primarily only if you
have id conflicts when using v10 and v11 packages at the same time during
migration.

In React, you can use IdPrefix anywhere in your component tree and specify the
prefix with the prefix prop. Most often it's used in the project root wrapping
the entire project

## Getting Started

First, run `yarn build` in the root of the `carbon` repository.

```sh
yarn install && yarn build
```

Now, all you need to do is `cd` into the directory and run:

```sh
yarn install
# or
npm install


yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the
result.

## Sass

First and foremost, if you want to use v11 styles in any capacity, you'll have
to migrate to use `dart-sass`. `node-sass` has been deprecated and we migrated
to `dart-sass` in v11. For more information about migrating, visit our docs
[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#changing-from-node-sass-to-sass).

## V10 and V11

This example is a v11 feature using the IdPrefix ðŸŽ‰. As mentioned above, it will
help with any id conflicts as you migrate over to v11.
