# Carbon Components

 The Carbon Design System is a series of individual styles and components, that when combined make beautiful, intuitive designs. These designs are systemic and logical, as they all follow the same universal principles.

The component library gives developers a collection of re-usable HTML and SCSS partials for building their products.

# How to install

Using npm,

```
npm install -S carbon-components
