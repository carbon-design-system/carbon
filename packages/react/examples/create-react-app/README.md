## Usage

To run this example, all you need to do is `cd` into the directory, run
`yarn install`, and then `yarn start`.

Ensure that you have executed `yarn build` in the root directory of your project before run `yarn start`.

## Deviations from vanilla `create-react-app`

Unfortunately, `create-react-app` doesn't support `.scss` files out-of-the-box,
so in this example we've had to run the `yarn eject` command in order to gain
access to the webpack configuration for both development and production
environments.

The most notable change is adding two dependencies, `node-sass` and
`sass-loader`, and adding them to the pre-existing loader that handles `.css`
files.
