## Overview

There are 4 different types of notification components:
`ActionableNotification`, `InlineNotification`, `ToastNotification`, and
`unstable__StaticNotification`.

### ActionableNotification

`ActionableNotification` should be used when user action is required. It can
include an action, other interactive elements or rich text. It uses Toast-like
styling by default, but if you'd like it to be visually similar to an
InlineNotifcation, you can use the `inline` prop. If `actionButtonLabel` is not
provided, an action button will not be rendered. This component grabs and traps
focus until the action is acted upon or the notification is dismissed.

### InlineNotification & ToastNotification

`InlineNotification` and `ToastNotification` can not contain interactive
elements or rich text. These are announced by screenreaders when rendered. They
don't grab focus. Use them to provide the user with an alert, status, or log.

### unstable\_\_StaticNotification

`unstable__StaticNotification` is non-modal and should only be used inline with
content on the initial render of the page or modal. This should not be used for
real-time notifications or notifications responding to user input (unless the
page is completely refreshing and bumping the users focus back to the first
element in the dom/tab order). This is the most passive notification component
and is essentially just a styled div. If you place actions or interactive
elements within this component, place an `aria-describedby` on the interactive
element with a value that matches the `titleId` prop.
