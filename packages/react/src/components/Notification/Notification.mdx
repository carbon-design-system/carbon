## Overview

There are 4 different types of notification components:
`ActionableNotification`, `InlineNotification`, `ToastNotification`, and
`unstable__StaticNotification`.

### ActionableNotification

`ActionableNotification` should be used when user action is required. It can
include an action, other interactive elements or rich text. It uses Toast-like
styling by default, but if you'd like it to be visually similar to an
InlineNotifcation, you can use the `inline` prop. If `actionButtonLabel` is not
provided, an action button will not be rendered. This component grabs and traps
focus until the action is acted upon or the notification is dismissed.

### InlineNotification & ToastNotification

`InlineNotification` and `ToastNotification` can not contain interactive
elements or rich text. These are announced by screenreaders when rendered. They
don't grab focus. Use them to provide the user with an alert, status, or log.

### unstable\_\_StaticNotification

`unstable__StaticNotification` is non-modal and should only be used inline with
content on the initial render of the page or modal because it will not be
announced to screenreader users like the other notification components.

As such, this should not be used for real-time notifications or notifications
responding to user input (unless the page is completely refreshing and bumping
the users focus back to the first element in the dom/tab order). If a
StaticNotification is rendered after the initial render, screenreader users'
focus may have already passed this portion of the DOM and they will not know
that the notification has been rendered until they circle back to the beginning
of the page.

This is the most passive notification component and is essentially just a styled
div. If you place actions or interactive elements within this component, place
an `aria-describedby` on the interactive element with a value that matches the
`titleId` prop.
