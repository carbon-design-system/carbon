## Overview

You can build an accordion using a combination of the `Accordion` and
`AccordionItem` components. The `Accordion` components accepts a list of
`AccordionItem` components as `children` and each `AccordionItem` is responsible
for displaying the accordion's heading and panel content.

You can configure the accordion item's heading using the `title` prop.
Everything you pass in as a child of `AccordionItem` will be rendered in the
accordion's panel.

  <Story id="components-accordion--accordion" />
</Preview>

## Skeleton state

You can use the `AccordionSkeleton` component to render a skeleton variant of an
accordion. This is useful to display while content in your accordion is being
fetched from an external resource like an API.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-accordion--skeleton" />
</Preview>

## Component API

<Props />

Additional props passed into `Accordion` will be forwarded along to the
underlying accordion container.

### Accordion align

In rare cases, you may need to specify the alignment of the icon in the
accordion. You can use the `align` prop to specify the side where the icon
should be placed.

_Note: This prop must not be used to create a tree view or set of nested
accordions._

```jsx
<Accordion align="start">
  <AccordionItem title="Panel A">Panel A</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel B">Panel B</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel C">Panel C</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Accordion className

The `className` prop passed into `Accordion` will be forwarded along to the
underlying accordion container. This is useful for specifying a custom class
name for layout.

```jsx
<Accordion className="custom-class">
  <AccordionItem title="Panel A">Panel A</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel B">Panel B</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel C">Panel C</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### AccordionItem props

Additional props passed into `AccordionItem`, such as `onClick`, will be passed
through to the underlying accordion header.

### AccordionItem className

The `className` prop passed into `AccordionItem` will be forwarded along to the
underlying accordion header. This is useful for specifying a custom class name
for layout. As a reminder, the callback signature will look like
`({ isOpen: boolean, event: Event })` rather than the usual
`(event: Event, state: { isOpen: boolean })` until the next major version.

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel A" className="custom-class">
    Panel A
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel B">Panel B</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel C">Panel C</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### AccordionItem onHeadingClick

You can use the `onHeadingClick` prop to determine the state of the
`AccordionItem` when it is clicked. it will return

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem onHeadingClick={({ isOpen }) => console.log(isOpen)}>
    Panel A
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### AccordionItem title

You can use the `title` prop to specify the accordion item's heading. The
default behavior is to pass in a `string` as the title, however you can also
pass in a `node`.

_Note: A custom title prop that renders an interactive element is considered an
accessibility violation. For more information, visit our
[reference section](#why-is-interactive-content-in-a-heading-considered-an-accessibility-violation)
below._

```jsx
<Accordion align="start">
  <AccordionItem title={() => <span>Panel A</span>}>Panel A</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel B">Panel B</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel C">Panel C</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### AccordionSkeleton props

Additional props passed into `AccordionSkeleton` will be forwarded along to the
underlying skeleton container.

### AccordionSkeleton className

The `className` prop passed into `AccordionSkeleton` will be forwarded along to
the underlying skeleton container. This is useful for specifying a custom class
name for layout.

```jsx
<AccordionSkeleton className="custom-class" open count={3} />
```

## References

### Why is interactive content in a heading considered an accessibility violation?

When using the `title` prop from `Accordion`, it is possible to render arbitrary
markup within the accordion header. The accordion header itself is rendered as a
`<button>` and is considered an interactive element.

If you render an interactive element inside this header, then it becomes nested
inside the `<button>`. Common examples of this are buttons or links. Rendering
interactive content inside the accordion heading is not reachable via a keyboard
or screen reader.
