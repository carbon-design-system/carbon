## Overview

Links are used as navigational elements and can be used on their own or inline
with text. They provide a lightweight option for navigation but like other
interactive elements, too many links will clutter a page and make it difficult
for users to identify their next steps. This is especially true for inline
links, which should be used sparingly.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LinkStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

## Accessible Link with Icon

If the text of your link doesn't correspond to the action represented by the
icon, consider incorporating an `aria-label` for the icon. This will ensure that
visually impaired users can comprehend the outcome of clicking the link.
