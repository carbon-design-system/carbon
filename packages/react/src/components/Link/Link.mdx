## Overview

Links are used as navigational elements and can be used on their own or inline
with text. They provide a lightweight option for navigation but like other
interactive elements, too many links will clutter a page and make it difficult
for users to identify their next steps. This is especially true for inline
links, which should be used sparingly.
