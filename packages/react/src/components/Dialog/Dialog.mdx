## Overview

The `Dialog` component is a primitive that wraps the native `<dialog>` and
provides a composable api of related components that match the spec for Modals
and non-modal dialogs as documented in the Dialog pattern.

Chrome's built in focus wrap behavior includes the browser bar in the tab order.
This is expected and consistent with `alert()` behavior.
