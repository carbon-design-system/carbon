## Overview

A `ComboButton` can be used to offer additional, secondary actions in a
disclosed list next to the primary action. These additional actions must be
`MenuItem`s passed as `children`. The primary action's label is passed as
`props.label`.

```jsx
<ComboButton label="Primary action">
  <MenuItem label="Second action" />
  <MenuItem label="Third action" />
  <MenuItem label="Fourth action" />
</ComboButton>
```

## Menu Alignment (experimental)

The `menuAlignment` prop enables you to define the placement of the Menu in
relation to the `ComboButton`. For instance, setting `menuAlignment="top"` on
the `ComboButton` will render the Menu above the button.

If it seems your specified `menuAlignment` isn't working, it's because we
prioritize ensuring the Menu remains visible. We calculate the optimal position
to display the Menu in case the provided `menuAlignment` obscures it.

We encourage you to play around in the Storybook playground to better understand
the `menuAlignment` prop.
