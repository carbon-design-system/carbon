The `@carbon/react` codebase ships with a number of feature flags. These feature
flags enable new behavior and styling, allowing you to opt-in to new (and
sometimes breaking) changes while using the current version. A feature flag may
be configured in javascript, sass, or both.

This section in the storybook documents each feature flag that is available and
how to configure it. Folders and stories within this section in storybook show
components with all feature flags turned on.

## Turning on feature flags in Javascript/react

Use the FeatureFlag component to turn on a feature flag for a portion of your
application's react tree. Multiple feature flags can be configured at the same
time.

```jsx
import { FeatureFlags } from '@carbon/react';

<FeatureFlags enableV12TileDefaultIcons="true" enableASecondFeatureFlag="true">
  <Tile />
</FeatureFlags>;
```

The `FeatureFlag` component can be placed at any point in your react tree and
will impact all children components. You can turn on feature flags for your
entire app, or only certain pages/routes/sections of your application.

```jsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { FeatureFlags } from '@carbon/react';
import App from './App';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <FeatureFlags enableV12TileDefaultIcons="true">
      <App />
    </FeatureFlags>
  </StrictMode>
);
```


## Turning on feature flags in Sass

In Sass, you can enable feature flags in any of your stylesheets. Most often
this is done at the root/entrypoint stylesheet.

```sass
@use '@carbon/react/scss/feature-flags' with (
  $feature-flags: (
    'enable-experimental-tile-contrast': true,
  )
);
@use '@carbon/react';
```

Feature flags can also be enabled via the provided `enable()` mixin

```sass
@use '@carbon/react/scss/feature-flags';
@use '@carbon/react';

@include feature-flags.enable('enable-experimental-tile-contrast');
```
## Using Codemods for Migration

Codemods are code modification scripts that automate the necessary changes when migrating to new components and APIs. They reduce the manual effort required when adopting new features. Carbon provides codemods to help you enable feature flags and migrate to the new APIs these flags provide.

Some feature flags don't have codemods because:
- **Style only**: Flags like `enable-experimental-tile-contrast` only affect Sass styles with no changes to the javascript component API.
- **Config only**: Flags like `enable-experimental-focus-wrap-without-sentinels`, `enable-dialog-element`, and `enable-treeview-controllable` are configuration options that are enabled in just a few specific places in your application.
- **App level**: Flags like `enable-v12-dynamic-floating-styles` are designed to be applied at the application level to enable specific behaviors (like floating styles without full autoAlign behavior) and don't require widespread component changes.

### Using a Codemod

To use a codemod:

```bash
npx @carbon/upgrade migrate <codemod-name> --write
```

Example

```bash
npx @carbon/upgrade migrate enable-v12-overflowmenu --write
```

For more information on available codemods, see the [@carbon/upgrade](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/upgrade/README.md) documentation.

## FeatureFlags Prop Update

The `FeatureFlags` component has been updated to improve compatibility. The
`flags` object prop is now deprecated and is replaced with individual boolean
props for each feature flag.

The `flags` prop will be removed in a future release. Instead, use individual
boolean props for each feature flag. A `featureflag-deprecate-flags-prop`
codemod has been provided to help deprecate the `flags` object prop and switch
to individual boolean props.

Since we're no longer using the `flags` object and instead passing flag names directly as props, these flag names must now follow camelCase formatting to align with standard JSX prop naming conventions.

```bash
npx @carbon/upgrade migrate featureflag-deprecate-flags-prop --write
```

```jsx
//Before migration

 <FeatureFlags
  flags={{
    'enable-v12-tile-default-icons': true,
  }}>
    <App />
  </FeatureFlags>


//After migration

  <FeatureFlags enableV12TileDefaultIcons>
    <App />
  </FeatureFlags>
```
