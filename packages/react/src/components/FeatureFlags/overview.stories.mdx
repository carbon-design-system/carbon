The `@carbon/react` codebase ships with a number of feature flags. These feature
flags enable new behavior and styling, allowing you to opt-in to new (and
sometimes breaking) changes while using the current version. A feature flag may
be configured in javascript, sass, or both.

This section in the storybook documents each feature flag that is available and
how to configure it. Folders and stories within this section in storybook show
components with all feature flags turned on.

## Current feature flags

Flags prefixed with `enable-*` contain features we'd like consuming projects to
test and give us feedback on. They're generally stable and unlikely to change
but may change based on your feedback.

Flags prefixed with `enable-v12-*` are stable and won't change. They will be
marked as `true` or "on" by default in the next major version, v12.

For more details on this approach, see the
[feature flag documentation](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/experimental-code.md)
in the Carbon monorepo.

## Turning on feature flags in Javascript/react

Use the FeatureFlag component to turn on a feature flag for a portion of your
application's react tree. Multiple feature flags can be configured at the same
time.

```jsx
import { unstable_FeatureFlags as FeatureFlags } from '@carbon/react';

<FeatureFlags
  flags={{
    'enable-v12-tile-default-icons': true,
    'enable-a-second-feature-flag': true,
  }}>
  <Tile />
</FeatureFlags>;
```

The `FeatureFlag` component can be placed at any point in your react tree and
will impact all children components. You can turn on feature flags for your
entire app, or only certain pages/routes/sections of your application.

```jsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { unstable_FeatureFlags as FeatureFlags } from '@carbon/react';
import App from './App';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <FeatureFlags flags={{ 'enable-v12-tile-default-icons': true }}>
      <App />
    </FeatureFlags>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

## Turning on feature flags in Sass

In Sass, you can enable feature flags in any of your stylesheets. Most often
this is done at the root/entrypoint stylesheet.

```sass
@use '@carbon/react/scss/feature-flags' with (
  $feature-flags: (
    'enable-experimental-tile-contrast': true,
  )
);
@use '@carbon/react';
```

Feature flags can also be enabled via the provided `enable()` mixin

```sass
@use '@carbon/react/scss/feature-flags';
@use '@carbon/react';

@include feature-flags.enable('enable-experimental-tile-contrast');
```
