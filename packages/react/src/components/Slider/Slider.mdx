## Overview

Sliders provide a visual indication of adjustable content, where the user can
increase or decrease the value by moving the handle along a horizontal track.

## Component API

<ArgsTable />

### `step` Prop

If a `step` value other than `1` is provided, any number entered into the text
input must adhere to the step value. For example, if the `step` is `5`, with a
range of values from `0-100`, `40` would be valid, and `42` would be considered
`invalid`.

### `unstable_valueUpper` Prop

The Slider component can support two handles to specify a range. To enable this
behavior pass a value for the `unstable_valueUpper` prop. This sets the upper
bound of the range in addition to the `value` prop, which specifies the lower
bound. When in two handle mode, both `value` and `valueUpper` are provided as
keys to `onChange` function prop that is passed to the component.
