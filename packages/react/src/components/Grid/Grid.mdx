Carbon's grid components help developers use the
[2x Grid](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview). The
project provides `Grid`, `Row`, and `Column` components which can be used to
build a variety of layouts. You can import these components from
`carbon-components-react`:

```js
import { Grid, Row, Column } from 'carbon-components-react';
```

## Overview

Every layout starts with the `Grid` component. You can specify a `Grid` at the
top-level of your project, or at different depths provided that it can span 100%
width of its container.

Next, you will use a combination of `Row` and `Column`. You can have multiple
`Row` components in a `Grid`, and multiple `Column` components in a `Row`. Each
`Row` will contain all the `Column` components provided to it, as long as they
don't span more columns than the total number of columns in the grid.

To specify how many columns the `Column` component should span, you can use the
`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xlg`, or `max` props. These props are shorthand versions of
the names given to each of the breakpoints defined by the
[2x Grid](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation/#responsive-options).
In the example below, we will use the `lg` prop for the large breakpoint and the
number `4` to specify that each `Column` component should span 4 columns at that
breakpoint.

```js
import { Grid, Row, Column } from 'carbon-components-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Grid>
      <Row>
        <Column lg={4}>Span 4 of 12</Column>
        <Column lg={4}>Span 4 of 12</Column>
        <Column lg={4}>Span 4 of 12</Column>
        <Column lg={4}>Span 4 of 12</Column>
      </Row>
    </Grid>
  );
}
```

_Note: by default, `carbon-components` ships with a 12 column grid. You can
enable a 16 column grid, which will be the default grid in the next major
version, by using our
[feature flags in Sass](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/docs/guides/sass.md#feature-flags)._

You can pair up multiple breakpoint props to specify how many columns the
`Column` component should span at different break points. In the example below,
we will use the `sm`, `md`, and `lg` prop to specify how many columns the
`Column` components should span at the small, medium, and large breakpoints.

## Grid modes

There are several
[grid modes](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation/#grid-modes)
that you can use depending on the layout effect you're looking to achieve. By
default, `Grid` uses the wide grid mode with a 32px gutter. However, you can use
the `narrow` or `condensed` props to enable the narrow and condensed grid modes,
respectively.

The same way that you can pass in `narrow` or `condensed` to the `Grid`
component, you can also pass in `narrow` or `condensed` to a `Row` component to
enable a certain grid mode but only for a row. This can be useful when you need
to mix-and-match certain grid modes to achieve a particular layout.

## Auto columns

In some situations, you may want your content to span a specific proportion of
the grid without having to calculate it across every breakpoint. A common
use-case for this is if you have a row of four cards and want each to span 25%
width each.

In these situations, you can make use of the auto columns feature of the
`Column` component. Auto columns is enabled when you do not provide any
breakpoint props, and it will automatically set each column to a percentage of
the total available width.

For example, if you have on `Column` component it would span 100%, two `Column`
components would span 50% each, four `Column` components would span 25% each,
and so on.

## Offset columns

You can offset your `Column` components by a specific amount of columns using
the object form for each breakpoint prop. This specific prop type allows you to
pass in an object to each breakpoint prop and this object has two keys, `span`
and `offset`, which allow you to specify the total numbers of columns the
`Column` component spans, and how many columns to offset it by.

You can specify either prop in this object form, and can mix-and-match across
breakpoints. For example, the following snippet will have the `Column` component
span two columns at the small breakpoint and then four columns at the medium
breakpoint. At the medium breakpoint, it will be offset by two columns.

```jsx
<Column sm={2} md={{ span: 4, offset: 2 }} />
```

### Using the `as` prop

By default, `Grid`, `Row`, and `Column` will render as a `div`. However, you can
use the `as` prop to change this to another HTML element, or a custom component
from your project.

In the example below, we use the `as` prop on `Row` to change it from a `div` to
a `section`. Simililarly, we use the `as` prop on `Column` to change it from a
`div` to an `article`.

```jsx
import { Grid, Row, Column } from 'carbon-components-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Grid>
      <Row as="section">
        <Column as="article">Example content</Column>
        <Column as="article">Example content</Column>
        <Column as="article">Example content</Column>
        <Column as="article">Example content</Column>
      </Row>
    </Grid>
  );
}
```

You can also provide a custom component to the `as` prop. This custom component
should accept all props passed to it, like a class name for the column.

```jsx
import { Grid, Row, Column } from 'carbon-components-react';

function Article({ children, ...rest }) {
  return <article {...rest}>{children}</article>;
}

function CustomColumn({ children, ...rest }) {
  return <Column as={Article} {...rest}>{children}</Column:
}

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Grid>
      <Row>
        <CustomColumn>Example content</Column>
        <CustomColumn>Example content</Column>
        <CustomColumn>Example content</Column>
        <CustomColumn>Example content</Column>
      </Row>
    </Grid>
  );
}
```

## FAQ

### How can I hide columns at a certain breakpoint?

To hide a column at a specific breakpoint, you should specify 0 for the span of
the column at that particular breakpoint. For example, you can use the following
two forms for specifying column span and pass in 0 to either to hide the column
at the small breakpoint.

```jsx
<Column sm={0} />
<Column sm={{ span: 0 }} />
```

### Can I nest grid components?

At the moment, there is no ability to nest grid components. In the future, we
may take advantage of CSS Grid and
[subgrid](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-subgrid) alongside but at the moment we
are limited in terms of what we can support for nesting.

If you would like to contribute nesting for the grid components available, we
would love for you to get in touch!
