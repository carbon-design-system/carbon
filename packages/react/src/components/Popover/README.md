# Popover

A popover is a piece of UI that _pops over_ or renders on top of other UI on the
page. It's a component "primitive" meaning it can be used to help make more
complex components that utilize this behavior.

## Popover Behaviors

- popovers are invoked/shown by interacting with some other UI element either
  through click, hover, key press, or focus
- popovers can be dismissed either through blur, <kbd>esc</kbd> keypress, or by
  having a different popover be triggered and shown
- popovers are displayed on top of other UI and out of the normal page flow
  typically anchored to a triggering element
