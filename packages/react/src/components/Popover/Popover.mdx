## Overview

`Popover` is a primitive component used to build custom components which render
over other elements on the page. For example, `Popover` is used to build our
popover components in Carbon.

The `Popover` component accepts two items as `children`: a trigger element and a
`PopoverContent` component which contains the content to be rendered inside of
the `Popover`.

```jsx
import { Popover, PopoverContent } from '@carbon/react';
import React from 'react';

function CustomComponent() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <Popover open={open}>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => {
          setOpen(!open);
        }}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <PopoverContent>
        The content that is revealed by interacting with the Toggle button
      </PopoverContent>
    </Popover>
  );
}
```

## Visibility

The `open` prop allows you to control the visibility of the `Popover`. This is
often tracked in state and is toggled based on the trigger render inside of the
`Popover`. A trigger must be an interactive element and in most cases it will be
a `<button>`.

## Alignment

The `align` prop allows you to specify where your content should be placed
relative to the popover. For example, if you provide `align="top"` to the
`Popover` component then the popover will render above your component.
Similarly, if you provide `align="bottom"` then the popover will render below
your component.

You can also configure the placement of the caret, if it is enabled, by choosing
between `left` and `right` or `bottom` and `top`, depending on where your
popover is being rendered.

If you are using `align="top"`, then you can choose between `align="top-left"`
and `align="top-right"`. These options will place the caret closer to the left
or right edges of the popover.

If you are using `align="left"` or `align="right"`, you can use `top` or
`bottom` to control this alignment.

## Appearance

The `Popover` component has several props which you can use to customize its
appearance, including:

- `caret`: to conditionally display a `caret` or render the popover directly
  beside the trigger element
- `dropShadow`: to display a drop shadow on the popover content
- `highContrast`: to display a high contrast variant of the popover
