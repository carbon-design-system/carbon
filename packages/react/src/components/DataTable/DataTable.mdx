## Getting started

You can implement a data table in your project by importing the `DataTable`
component and using it along with any additional table components that you need.

```js
import {
  DataTable,
  Table,
  TableHead,
  TableRow,
  TableHeader,
  TableBody,
  TableCell,
} from 'carbon-components-react';
```

The `DataTable` component needs two props to be provided: `rows` and `headers`.
The `rows` prop is the data you would like to display in the rows of your table,
whereas `headers` specifies which table column headings should be displayed.

Each row in the `rows` prop should provide a unique `id`, but everything else
can be configured according to your data. For example:

```js
const rows = [
  {
    id: 'a',
    name: 'Load balancer 1',
    status: 'Disabled',
  },
  {
    id: 'b',
    name: 'Load balancer 2',
    status: 'Starting',
  },
  {
    id: 'c',
    name: 'Load balancer 3',
    status: 'Active',
  },
];
```

The `headers` will specify the column headers in your table. The `header`
property for each item will describe what the user sees in the table column
header. The `key` property is used to relate what value a row has for the given
column.

```js
const headers = [
  {
    key: 'name',
    header: 'Name',
  },
  {
    key: 'status',
    header: 'Status',
  },
];
```

You can use the `rows` and `headers` props above to render a `DataTable` by
writing:

```jsx
<DataTable rows={rows} headers={headers}>
  {({ rows, headers, getTableProps, getHeaderProps, getRowProps }) => (
    <Table {...getTableProps()}>
      <TableHead>
        <TableRow>
          {headers.map((header) => (
            <TableHeader {...getHeaderProps({ header })}>
              {header.header}
            </TableHeader>
          ))}
        </TableRow>
      </TableHead>
      <TableBody>
        {rows.map((row) => (
          <TableRow {...getRowProps({ row })}>
            {row.cells.map((cell) => (
              <TableCell key={cell.id}>{cell.value}</TableCell>
            ))}
          </TableRow>
        ))}
      </TableBody>
    </Table>
  )}
</DataTable>
```

After rendering a `DataTable` component using the code snippet above, you can
optionally add any number of features including sorting, row expansion,
filtering, row selection, batch actions.

For more information, see each usage section below for the functionality that
you're interested in. If you want to see a full list of the arguments passed
into your render prop, visit the [render props](#render-props) section.

## Sorting

In order to sort the rows in your data table, you will need to pass in the
`isSortable` prop to the `DataTable` component.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-datatable-sorting--usage" />
</Preview>

Optionally, you can pass in `isSortable` to each `TableHeader` that you want to
be sorted, or not sorted. This is useful if you only want to enable sorting on
some table column headers, but not all.

```jsx
<TableHeader {...getHeaderProps({ header, isSortable: false })}>
  {header.header}
</TableHeader>
```

### Programmatic sorting

In addition to the prop getter specified in the previous section, you can also
change the sort status of the table by using the `sortBy` action made available
in your `render` prop function. This `sortBy` utility takes in the `key` of the
header you want to sort by as an argument. After invoking this method with the
given `key`, the table should be sorted by the header that you've specified.

### Custom sorting

If the default sorting logic doesn't match your use-case, you can provide a
custom sort method as a `sortRow` prop to `DataTable`.

`sortRow` is a method that takes in the values of two cells, in addition to some
info, and should return -1, 0, or 1 as a result (mirroring the native sort
behavior in JavaScript).

The two cells that are passed in are derived by accessing the value of the sort
header in each row that we're comparing. For example, if we're sorting on the
`Foo` header, with the `foo` key available in each row, then for row `a` and row
`b` we would get the `a.foo` and `b.foo` field values.

As a result, a custom `sortRow` function would take on the following shape:

```js
function customSortRow(cellA, cellB, { sortDirection, sortStates, locale }) {
  if (sortDirection === sortStates.DESC) {
    return compare(cellB, cellA, locale);
  }

  return compare(cellA, cellB, locale);
}
```

## Expansion

The `DataTable` components supports row-level expansion when combined with the
`TableExpandHeader`, `TableExpandRow`, and `TableExpandedRow` components.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-datatable-expansion--usage" />
</Preview>

_Note: press "Show code" above to view a code snippet of this example_

The `TableExpandHeader` is placed before all the other headers as a placeholder
column. In each row that you would like to be expanded, you will use
`TableExpandRow`. It's important that `getRowProps` is applied to
`TableExpandRow` so that it has the necessary props. `TableExpandedRow` is used
for the content that will be displayed only when the row is expanded.

### Programmatic expansion

You can use the `expandRow` action made available through your `render` prop
function to toggle the expansion state of a given row. This method takes in the
row id as a single argument.

## Selection

The `DataTable` component supports row selection when used with the
`TableSelectAll` and `TableSelectRow` components.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-datatable-selection--usage" />
</Preview>

_Note: press "Show code" above to view a code snippet of this example_

In the example above, `TableSelectAll` is placed before all other headers. You
should use `getSelectionProps` on `TableSelectAll` to enable selecting all rows
in the table.

`TableSelectRow` is also used in this example, and is placed before all the
cells in a row. It also uses `getSelectionProps` props, but also takes in the
current `row` in order to retrieve selection state about the given row.

You can access all the selected rows through the `selectedRows` property passed
into your `render` prop function.

#### Programmatic selection

You can use either of the following actions from your `render` prop function to
update the selection status of a row:

- `selectAll`: invoking this will toggle the selection of all rows, either by
  making all selected or de-selecting all rows
- `selectRow`: invoking this will toggle the selection of a specific row. Takes
  in a valid row id as an argument

## Filtering

Filtering in a `DataTable` is provided through usage of the `TableToolbar` and
the `TableToolbarSearch` component. Any input entered through
`TableToolbarSearch` will be used when the `filterRows` prop is applied

By default `filterRows` is provided through our default implementation. However,
you can provide your own method if needed.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-datatable-filtering--usage" />
</Preview>

In order to integrate filtering into your data table, you will need to provide
the `onInputChange` function provided to you from `DataTable`'s render prop and
pass it to the `onChange` prop of `TableToolbarSearch` in your `TableToolbar`
component.

## Batch actions

You can combine batch actions with the `DataTable` component to allow the user
to perform a single action on multiple selected rows. To do this, you can use
the following components:

- `TableToolbar`
- `TableToolbarAction`
- `TableToolbarSearch`
- `TableBatchActions`
- `TableBatchAction`
- `TableSelectAll`
- `TableSelectRow`

## Props

<Props />

### Render props

The types of arguments that this function has are as follows:

- [Prop Getters](#prop-getters)
- [Actions](#actions)
- [State](#state)

#### Prop getters

> See
> [the blog post about prop getters](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/how-to-give-rendering-control-to-users-with-prop-getters-549eaef76acf)

These functions are used to apply props to the elements that you render. The
idea behind this is that it can allow you more flexibility when deciding when to
render, and where, while still allowing `DataTable` to help orchestrate state
changes inside of the Table itself.

You are able to call these on specific elements in your `render` prop function
by doing the following:

```jsx
<TableHeader {...getHeaderProps({ header })}>{header.header}</TableHeader>
```

In order to make sure that everything works as intended, it's important that you
pass all of the `props` that you want to place on the component as fields on the
object you give to a prop getter. For example, if you wanted to add an `onClick`
handler to `TableHeader` above, you would do the following:

```js
<TableHeader {...getHeaderProps({ header, onClick: this.handleOnClick })}>
  {header.header}
</TableHeader>
```

| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getHeaderProps`    | `({ header }) => props` | returns the props you should apply to a specific header  |
| `getRowProps`       | `({ row }) => props`    | returns the props you should apply to a specific row     |
| `getSelectionProps` | `({ row? }) => props`   | returns the props you should apply to selection elements |

#### Actions

These are functions you can call to change the state of the `DataTable`
component.
