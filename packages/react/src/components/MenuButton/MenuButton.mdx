## Overview

A `MenuButton` can be used to group a set of actions that are related. These
actions must be `MenuItem`s passed as `children`. The trigger buttons's label is
passed as `props.label`.

```jsx
<MenuButton label="Actions">
  <MenuItem label="First action" />
  <MenuItem label="Second action" />
  <MenuItem label="Third action" />
</MenuButton>
```

## Menu Alignment

The `menuAlignment` prop enables you to define the placement of the Menu in
relation to the `MenuButton`. For instance, setting `menuAlignment="top"` on the
`MenuButton` will render the Menu above the button.

If it seems your specified `menuAlignment` isn't working, it's because we
prioritize ensuring the Menu remains visible. We calculate the optimal position
to display the Menu in case the provided `menuAlignment` obscures it.

We encourage you to play around in the Storybook Default stories to better
understand the `menuAlignment` prop.

## menuTarget Prop

The `menuTarget` prop specifies where the `Menu` should render, which is
particularly useful when using `MenuButton` inside a modal. By default, the menu
renders in `document.body`, but this can disrupt focus order in modals or other
components with focus management.

Pass the `menuTarget` prop to render the `Menu` inside the modal or any specific
element where you want it to render:
