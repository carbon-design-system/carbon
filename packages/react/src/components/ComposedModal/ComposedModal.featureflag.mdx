## `enable-dialog-element`

`ComposedModal` supports the `enable-dialog-element` feature flag. This enables
a new approach internal to the ComposedModal that uses the native `<dialog>`
element. With this, the browser natively controls the focus wrap behavior. This
means that the DOM no longer includes the "sentinel nodes" previously needed for
the ComposedModal to manage focus wrap.

`ComposedModal` also supports the
`enable-experimental-focus-wrap-without-sentinels` feature flag that was
implemented previous to the dialog element refactor. In ComposedModal, this flag
is an alias for the `enable-dialog-element` flag. They do the same thing and you
only need to use one, preferably `enable-dialog-element`.

## Enabling the flag

To enable the flag, use the `FeatureFlags` component and set the prop:

```js
<FeatureFlags enableDialogElement>
  <ComposedModal ... />
</FeatureFlags>
```
