## Table of Contents

## Overview

TreeView is a component that allows users to navigate through a hierarchy of items. It is used to display nested lists of items that can be expanded or collapsed to show and hide additional items.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={TreeViewStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

## With Controlled Expansion

The `expanded` prop can be used to control the expansion state of the TreeView. The `isExpanded` prop can be used to determine if an individual tree node is expanded or collapsed.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={TreeViewStories.WithControlledExpansion} />
</Canvas>

## With Custom Icons

The `renderIcon` prop can be used to customize the icons of each node in the TreeView.

  <Story of={TreeViewStories.WithCustomIcons} />
