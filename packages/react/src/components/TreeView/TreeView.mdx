## Table of Contents

## Overview

TreeView is a component that allows users to navigate through a hierarchy of
items. It is used to display nested lists of items that can be expanded or
collapsed to show and hide additional items.

<Canvas of={TreeViewStories.Default} />

## With Controlled Expansion

The `expanded` prop can be used to control the expansion state of the TreeView.
The `isExpanded` prop can be used to determine if an individual tree node is
expanded or collapsed.

<Canvas of={TreeViewStories.WithControlledExpansion} />

## With Custom Icons

The `renderIcon` prop can be used to customize the icons of each node in the
TreeView.
