# TreeView controllable API

The new controllable API of TreeView allows you to synchronize the state of `selected` and `active` with your application.

You can opt-in to this by enabling the `enable-treeview-controllable` feature flag. This changes the following behaviour:

- `TreeView`
  - `props.onActivate` will be called with a node's ID whenever it is activated.
  - The signature of `props.onSelect` changes from `(event, selectedIDs)` to `(selectedIDs)`.
  - Whenever you update `props.selected` or `props.active`, the internal state will be updated accordingly and the component re-renders.
- `TreeNode`
  - The signature of `props.onToggle` changes from `(event, { id, isExpanded, label, value })` to `(isExpanded)`.
  - `props.defaultIsExpanded` is added to allow for a default state in uncontrolled mode.

## Example

```jsx
function SynchronizedTreeView() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState([]);
  const [active, setActive] = useState(null);

  return (
    <TreeView
      selected={selected}
      onSelect={setSelected}
      active={active}
      onActivate={setActive}
    >
      ...
    </TreeView>
  );
}
```
