## Overview

The `Layer` component is used to render components on different layers. Each
layer has a specific set of token values associated with it. You can use these
tokens directly, or use contextual tokens from our styles package like `$layer`
or `$field`.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayerStories.Default} />
</Canvas>


The `Layer` component accepts `children` as a prop. Each child of a `Layer`
component is rendered using the layer tokens at that layer. `Layer` components
can be nested indefinitely, but the token sets typically end after 3 layers.

```jsx
<Layer>
  <ChildComponent />
  <Layer>
    <ChildComponent />
    <Layer>
      <ChildComponent />
    </Layer>
  </Layer>
</Layer>
```

## Setting a custom level

You can override the `level` of a `Layer` if you would like to change the presentation of a layer in your application. This is particularly helpful if you would like to reset the `Layer` level back to `0` or if you want to make sure a part of a page always renders in a certain level.

To do this, you can use the `level` prop:

```jsx
<Layer>
  <ChildComponent />
  <Layer level={0}>
    <ChildComponent />
  </Layer>
</Layer>
```

## Get the current layer

If you are building a component and would like to know what layer the component
resides within, you can use the `useLayer` hook.

This hook returns an object with the current `level` of the layer:

```jsx
function ExampleComponent() {
  const { level } = useLayer();

  // ...
}
```

If the structure of `Layer` components in your app change, the hook will automatically update with the new `level`.

The `level` value can be one of: `0`, `1`, or `2` and will correspond to the level of
the current layer. This value mirrors the `level` prop on the `Layer` component.

## Component API

<ArgsTable />

### Layer as

You can configure the base element rendered by `Layer` using the `as` prop. For
example, if you would like the `Layer` component to render as a `section` you
could write the following:

```jsx
<Layer as="section">
  <ChildComponent />
</Layer>
```

Similarly, you can provide any custom component to the `as` prop which the
`Layer` component will use.
