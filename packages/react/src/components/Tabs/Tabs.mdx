## Overview

Use tabs to allow users to navigate easily between views within the same
context. Tabs are now more composable, meaning that you have more flexibility in
what is in rendered inside of `Tab` and `TabPanel`.

### Tab - render content on click

You will occasionally run into a situation where you only want Tab content to be
loaded when the Tab is clicked. In v11, to do this, you can this by setting
`activation` to `manual`:

```jsx
<Tabs>
  <TabList aria-label="List of tabs" activation="manual">
    <Tab>Tab Label 1</Tab>
    <Tab>Tab Label 2</Tab>
    <Tab>Tab Label 3</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>Tab Panel 1</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Tab Panel 2</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Tab Panel 3</TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

## V11

### Tabs composition

Tabs got a big revamp in v11! Tabs are now more composable than ever before,
meaning that you have the flexibity and control on your end to make them look
and act how you want. The biggest difference is that the Tab label and the Tab
content are now separate components.

Example of Tabs in v10:

```js
<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Tab label 1">
    <p>Content for first tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Tab label 2">
    <p>Content for second tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Tab label 3" disabled>
    <p>Content for third tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab
    label="Tab label 4 shows truncation"
    title="Tab label 4 shows truncation">
    <p>Content for fourth tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

Those same Tabs, now in v11:

```js
<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Tab Label 1</Tab>
    <Tab>Tab Label 2</Tab>
    <Tab disabled>Tab Label 3</Tab>
    <Tab title="Tab Label 4 shows truncation">Tab Label 4 shows truncation</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>Content for first tab goes here.</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Content for second tab goes here.</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Content for third tab goes here.</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Content for fourth tab goes here.</TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

### Various updates

All the same functionality for Tabs is available in v11 and more! Below are the
minor tweaks in naming or implementation.

- the `type` prop is deprecated. Both "container" and "default" tabs still exist
  but now can be called by adding the prop `contained` to the `TabList`. See the
  above "Contained Tabs" for an example.
- Default tabs are now referred to as line tabs in our documentation here and on
  our website.
- `hidden` prop is no longer needed with the new composable Tabs. You have full
  control over tab content and when it's hidden through the `TabPanel` and
  `TabPanels` components.
- `selected` prop is now named `selectedIndex`.
- `tabContentClassName` is no longer needed. `TabPanel` (equivalent to tab
  content) takes in a className prop on its outermost node.
- For `Tab`, `label` is no longer needed. `children` of `Tab` are now the label.
- Due to its composability, `renderAnchor`, `renderButton`, `renderContent` are
  no longer needed on `Tab`.
- `selected` on `Tab` is deprecated in favor or `selectedIndex`, now placed on
  `Tabs` instead.
- Because `renderButton` is no longer needed, the associated `tabIndex` prop has
  also been deprecated.
