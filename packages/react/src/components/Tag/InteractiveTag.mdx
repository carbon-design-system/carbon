## Overview

Tags can be used to categorize items. Use short labels for easy scanning. Use
two words only if necessary to describe the status and differentiate it from
other tags.

## Dismissible

Dismissible tags are used to remove tags that can be filtered out by the user.

When to use:

- Use DismissibleTag when you want to allow users to easily clear or dismiss
  specific filters applied to items.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={InteractiveTagStories.Dismissible} />
</Canvas>

```jsx
<DismissibleTag
  type="red"
  className="some-class"
  title="Clear Filter"
  renderIcon={AsSleep}>
  {'Tag content'}
</DismissibleTag>
```

## Selectable

Selectable tags are used to select or unselect single or multiple items.
Selectable tags can also be used in filtering by label scenarios when they do
not need to be dismissed.

When to use:

- Use selectable tags to toggle between a selected or unselected state.
- Use when needing to filter without an explicit dismissable functionality. (We
  need to be a little more specific around filtering for selectable versus
  dismissable tags).

<Canvas>
  <Story of={InteractiveTagStories.Selectable} />
</Canvas>

```jsx
<SelectableTag className="some-class" renderIcon={Asleep}>
  {'Tag content'}
</SelectableTag>
```

## Operational

Operational tags enable the user to view a list of all items associated with a
given tag in different ways.

When to use:

- Use to view a list of items with the same tag in a toggletip, popover, or
  breadcrumb detail view.

When not to use:

- Do not use operational tags as a replacement for links that direct you to an
  entirely different page or launch you out to another tab.
- Do not use in combination with Dismissable tags. Instead, consider letting the
  user enter an "edit mode" to dismiss tags.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={InteractiveTagStories.Operational} />
</Canvas>

```jsx
<OperationalTag type="red" className="some-class" renderIcon={Asleep}>
  {'Tag content'}
</OperationalTag>
```
