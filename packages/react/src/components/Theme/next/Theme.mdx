## Overview

The `Theme` component allows you to specify the theme for a page, or a portion
of a page. It is most often used to implement inline theming in order to specify
what theme a section of the page should render with.

The `Theme` component accepts a `theme` prop which allows you to specify the
theme. This value is propagated to the entire sub-tree of components and can be
accessed by any child component using the `useTheme` hook.

```jsx
<Theme theme="g100">
  <ChildComponent />
</Theme>
```

The `Theme` component will render a wrapper element on which all of the values
of the given theme will be applied as CSS Custom Properties. These CSS Custom
Properties can be accessed directly, or you can use the Sass Variables provided
in the styles from the Carbon Design System to refer to these properties in your
styles.

### `useTheme`

The `useTheme` hook allows you to access the current theme in a component. This
can be useful if you need to conditionally render something based on the theme.
For example, if you have an illustration that needs to be rendered differently
in a light or dark theme.

You can use this hook in any component by calling `useTheme`:

```jsx
function ExampleComponent() {
  const { theme } = useTheme();

  if (theme === 'g100') {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Component API

<Props />

### Theme as

You can configure the base element rendered by `Theme` using the `as` prop. For
example, if you would like the `Theme` component to render as a `section` you
could write the following:

```jsx
<Theme as="section" theme="g100">
  <ChildComponent />
</Theme>
```

Similarly, you can provide any custom component to the `as` prop which the
`Theme` component will use.
