## Overview

The `GlobalTheme` and `Theme` components allow you to specify the theme for a
page, or for a part of a page, respectively. `Theme` is most often used to
implement inline theming where you can style a portion of your page with a
particular theme. A `Zone` component is available to both set the theme for a
portion of a page along with setting common styles like background and text
color automatically.

In order for the styles of `Theme` and `Zone` to be correctly applied in your project, you
need to make sure that you have included `@carbon/react/scss/zone` in your Sass
files by writing:

```scss
@use '@carbon/react/scss/zone';
```

You also get this file when you import `@carbon/react` directly in your Sass.

## Setting the global theme

Use the `GlobalTheme` component to set the theme for your entire project. By
default, the global theme will be set to the `white` theme. You can change the
global theme value by using the `theme` prop on `GlobalTheme`:

```jsx
import { GlobalTheme } from '@carbon/react';

<GlobalTheme theme="g100">
  <YourApp />
</GlobalTheme>;
```

Note: this component should be used at the root of your app.

## Setting an inline theme

Use the `Theme` component to set an inline theme for a part of the UI in your
project. All components that you render as `children` of `Theme` will now use
the design token values from that theme.

```jsx
import { Theme } from '@carbon/react';

function ExamplePage() {
  return (
    <GlobalTheme theme="white">
      <h1>Page title</h1>
      <p>Display in the white theme</p>
      <Theme theme="g100">
        <p>Display in the g100 theme</p>
      </Theme>
    <GlobalTheme>
  );
}
```

Note: the `Theme` component only sets the value of the CSS Custom Properties
used by the theme. It will not automatically set the background or text color of
a part of a page. For this use-case, you can use the `Zone` component.

This component has the same signature as `Theme` and will also set the
background and text color for the part of a page.

```jsx
import { Zone } from '@carbon/react';

function ExamplePage() {
  return (
    <GlobalTheme theme="white">
      <h1>Page title</h1>
      <p>Display in the white theme</p>
      <Zone theme="g100">
        <p>Display in the g100 theme</p>
      </Zone>
    <GlobalTheme>
  );
}
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-theme--zone-story" />
</Canvas>

## Getting the current theme in a component

The `useTheme` hook provides the current theme for a component. This can be
helpful if you need to conditionally render items based on the current theme.

```jsx
import { useTheme } from '@carbon/react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const { theme } = useTheme();

  // Use the current theme in your component
}
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-theme--use-theme" />
</Canvas>

## Component API

<ArgsTable />

### Theme as

You can configure the base element rendered by `Theme` using the `as` prop. For
example, if you would like the `Theme` component to render as a `section` you
could write the following:

```jsx
<Theme as="section" theme="g100">
  <ChildComponent />
</Theme>
```

Similarly, you can provide any custom component to the `as` prop which the
`Theme` component will use.
