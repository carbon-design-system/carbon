# ModalWrapper deprecation

## Timeline

The `<ModalWrapper/>` component has been deprecated in v11 and will be removed
in v12.

## Migration Strategy

The `<ComposedModal/>` component will be used in favor of the `<ModalWrapper/>`
going forward. The `<ComposedModal/>` is used along with any of these 3 children
components: `<ModalHeader/>`, `<ModalBody/>` and `<ModalFooter/>`. This makes
the `<ComposedModal/>` more customizable as you can choose what to include in
it. A notable difference is that the modal trigger has to be custom implemented
now.
