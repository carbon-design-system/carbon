## Overview

You may be familiar with the `dir` or `direction` property in HTML and CSS. This
direction is commonly seen as the way to enable LTR (left to right) or RTL
(right to left) experiences on the web. However, one common misconception is
that you will want a page to always be LTR or RTL. In certain situations, you
may want the layout direction to be different than the text direction. This
series of primitive components is provided to enable the changing of directions
for individual text nodes, entire sections of your app, or to change layout
direction independently of text direction.

## Text

`Text` can be used for applying the correct `dir` attribute on a particular text
node based on the `TextDirection`, defaulting to `auto`.

## Layout Direction

`LayoutDirection` can be used for setting the layout direction in a part of an
application.

## Text Direction

`TextDirection` can be used for setting the text direction in a part of an
application. It allows you to force the text direction of any particular text in
the sub-tree.

## Usage Examples

It is important to note that not all Carbon components will use `Text`
internally. Carbon components that accept a property of type `string` should use
`Text` internally around any usage of the property.

For components that accept properties of type `node`, such as the common
`children`, `Text` will not be used internally. You can compose `Text` within
these properties directly. This also applies to components that utilize string
transformation functions that return nodes, like `itemToElement` on `Dropdown`.
The Usage Examples story below provides some examples of how to do this with
various components.
