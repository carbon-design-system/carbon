## Overview

Radio buttons represent a group of mutually exclusive choices, compared to
checkboxes that allow users to make one or more selections from a group. In use
cases where only one selection from a group is allowed, use the radio button
component instead of the checkbox. Though the `RadioButton` components may be rendered 
individually, it is recommended they be rendered as children components of the 
`RadioButtonGroup` parent component to maintain their proper controlled states.
