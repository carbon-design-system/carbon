## `enable-experimental-focus-wrap-without-sentinels`

`Modal` supports the `enable-experimental-focus-wrap-without-sentinels` feature
flag. When enabled, the hidden "sentinel nodes" used for focus wrap are no
longer emitted to the DOM. These were previously used to mark the beginning and
end of the area where focus should wrap within.

The new behavior looks at all interactive child nodes and wraps focus based on
tabbable order of those nodes. The focus direction is determined whether `tab`
is being pressed (forward) or `shift`+`tab` is being pressed (backwards).

Note: The native dialog element handles focus, so `enable-dialog-element` must
be off for `enable-experimental-focus-wrap-without-sentinels` to have any
effect.

### Enabling the flag

To enable the flag, use the `FeatureFlags` component and set the prop:

```js
<FeatureFlags enableExperimentalFocusWrapWithoutSentinels>
  <Modal ... />
</FeatureFlags>
```

## `enable-dialog-element`

`Modal` supports the `enable-dialog-element` feature flag. When enabled, Modal
will use the native `<dialog>` element instead of `role="dialog"`. With the
`<dialog>` element, the browser natively controls the focus wrap behavior. This
means that:

- The DOM no longer includes the "sentinel nodes" previously needed for the
  Modal to manage focus wrap.
- `enable-experimental-focus-wrap-without-sentinels` has no effect and can be
  removed when using `enable-dialog-element`

### Enabling the flag

To enable the flag, use the `FeatureFlags` component and set the prop:

```js
<FeatureFlags enableDialogElement>
  <Modal ... />
</FeatureFlags>
```
