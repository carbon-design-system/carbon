## Experimental focus wrap without sentinels

`Modal` supports the `enable-experimental-focus-wrap-without-sentinels` feature
flag. This enables a new approach to the focus wrap behavior that modifies the
DOM to no longer include hidden "sentinel nodes" used to mark the beginning and
end of the wrapped focus. The new behavior looks at all interactive child nodes
and wraps focus based on tabbable order of those nodes. The focus direction is
determined whether `tab` is being pressed (forward) or `shift`+`tab` is being
pressed (backwards). In javascript you can enable this feature flag to use the
new focus wrap behavior.

```js
<FeatureFlags
  flags={{
    'enable-experimental-focus-wrap-without-sentinels': true,
  }}>
  <Modal />
</FeatureFlags>
```
