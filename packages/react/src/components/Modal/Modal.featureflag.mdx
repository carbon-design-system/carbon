## `enable-dialog-element`

`Modal` supports the `enable-dialog-element` feature flag. This enables a new
approach internal to the Modal that uses the native `<dialog>` element. With
this, the browser natively controls the focus wrap behavior. This means that the
DOM no longer includes the "sentinel nodes" previously needed for the Modal to
manage focus wrap.

`Modal` also supports the `enable-experimental-focus-wrap-without-sentinels`
feature flag that was implemented previous to the dialog element refactor. In
Modal, this flag is an alias for the `enable-dialog-element` flag. They do the
same thing and you only need to use one, preferably `enable-dialog-element`.

## Enabling the flag

To enable the flag, use the `FeatureFlags` component and set the prop:

```js
<FeatureFlags enableDialogElement>
  <Modal ... />
</FeatureFlags>
```
