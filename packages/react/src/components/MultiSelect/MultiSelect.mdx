### With initial selected items

By passing items into the `initialSelectedItems` prop, they can be pre-selected.

<Canvas of={MultiSelect.WithInitialSelectedItems} />

### Select all

The MultiSelect component includes a "Select All" feature, allowing users to
easily select or deselect all options with a single action.

To implement the "Select All" feature in your MultiSelect component, add a new
option to your options array with these properties:

- `id`: A unique identifier (e.g., 'select-all')
- `text`: The label for the option
- `isSelectAll`: Set to `true`

```
const options = [
  {
    id: 'select-all',
    text: 'All roles',
    isSelectAll: true,
  },
  // ... other options
];
```

### Filtering

The `FilterableMultiSelect` component allows for filtering the list of
selectable items to a subset. The `FilterableMultiSelect` component allows for
filtering the list of selectable items to a subset.

## Component API

### `downshiftProps`

This component utilizes [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/) under the
hood to help provide complex yet accessible custom dropdown components. We
provide access to the built in Downshift features with this prop.

Use with caution: anything you define here overrides the components' internal
handling of that prop. Downshift internals are subject to change, and in some
cases they can not be shimmed to shield you from potentially breaking changes.

For more information, checkout the Downshift prop
[documentation](https://www.downshift-js.com/downshift#props-used-in-examples)
