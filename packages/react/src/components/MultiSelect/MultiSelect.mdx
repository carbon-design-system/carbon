## Overview

The `MultiSelect` component is a variant of the `Dropdown` component that allows
for multiple items to be selected. `MultiSelect` stays open while items are
being selected.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={MultiSelect.Default} />
</Canvas>

### With initial selected items

By passing items into the `initialSelectedItems` prop, they can be pre-selected.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={MultiSelect.WithInitialSelectedItems} />
</Canvas>

### Filtering

The `FilterableMultiSelect` component allows for filtering the list of
selectable items to a subset.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={MultiSelect.Filterable} />
</Canvas>

### With layer

<Canvas>
  <Story of={MultiSelect.WithLayerMultiSelect} />
</Canvas>

## Component API

### `downshiftProps`

This component utilizes [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/) under the
hood to help provide complex yet accessible custom dropdown components. We
provide access to the built in Downshift features with this prop.

Use with caution: anything you define here overrides the components' internal
handling of that prop. Downshift internals are subject to change, and in some
cases they can not be shimmed to shield you from potentially breaking changes.

For more information, checkout the Downshift prop
[documentation](https://www.downshift-js.com/downshift#props-used-in-examples)
