## Component API

### `downshiftProps`

This component utilizes [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/) under the
hood to help provide complex yet accessible custom dropdown components. We
provide access to the built in Downshift features with this prop.

Use with caution: anything you define here overrides the components' internal
handling of that prop. Downshift internals are subject to change, and in some
cases they can not be shimmed to shield you from potentially breaking changes.

For more information, checkout the Downshift prop
[documentation](https://www.downshift-js.com/downshift#props-used-in-examples)
