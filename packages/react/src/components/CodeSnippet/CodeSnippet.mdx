## Overview

Code snippets are strings or small blocks of reusable code that are copyable. We
don't provide the copy functionality and recommend
[clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/).

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CodeSnippetStories.Inline} />
</Canvas>

## Skeleton state

You can use the `CodeSnippetSkeleton` component to render a skeleton variant of
an code snippet. This is useful to display while content in your code snippet is
being fetched from an external resource like an API.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CodeSnippetStories.Skeleton} />
</Canvas>

## Inline

Inline code snippet's are used for distinguishing a symbol, variable, function
name or similar small piece of code from it's surrounding text.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CodeSnippetStories.Inline} />
</Canvas>

## Multi-line

Multiple line code snippets are used for displaying code with more than one
line. They're shown in a block and useful for showing classes, functions, blocks
of styles and the like. There is an option to wrap the lines displayed if the
lines are longer than the container.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CodeSnippetStories.Multiline} />
</Canvas>

## Single-line

Single line code snippets are used when showing code that fits on one line
without wrapping. Useful for calling out terminal commands, function
invocations, expressions etc.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CodeSnippetStories.Singleline} />
</Canvas>

## Component API

<ArgsTable />

## Migration notes

- `copyLabel` has been deprecated in favor of `ariaLabel`.
