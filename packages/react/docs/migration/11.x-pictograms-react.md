## Process

1. Update your `carbon-pictograms-react` package using `npm` or `yarn`.
1. When migrating from v10 to v11, you'll first want to address your pictogram
   instances marked with `removed` in the table below. E.g. if you're using the
   `<BerlinBrandenburg />` pictogram React component that was previously
   available in Carbon, you'll need to either remove your pictogram component or
   create your own pictogram component so the `<BerlinBrandenburg />` syntax is
   recognized in your client-side JavaScript.

## Changes:
