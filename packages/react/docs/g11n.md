# Notes of globalization

- For simple components, translatable strings can be provided via React props.
  Click on "Show Info" button at the top right in each components' page in
  http://react.carbondesignsystem.com for more details.
- Some components have `translateWithId` props, that is API-compatible with
  [`react-i18next`](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) library. Search
  for
  [`translationIds`](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-react/search?q=translationIds&unscoped_q=translationIds)
  or
  [`translationKeys`](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-react/search?q=translationKeys&unscoped_q=translationKeys)
  to see the list of string IDs.
- Some components, e.g. `<AccordionItem>`, work as list items. They should be
  ordered with locale-specific sorting rules in mind.
- Some components, e.g. `<DataTable>`, support
  [custom sorting](../src/components/DataTable/README.md#custom-sorting). Such
  custom sorting logic should take locale-specific sorting rules into account.
- Date picker component relies on the G11N features in
  [`Flatpickr` library](https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/). Set `locale` and
  `dateFormat` props to fully utilize `Flatpickr` library's G11N features.
- Also refer to
  [G11N considerations in our vanilla library](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components/tree/master/docs/g11n.md).
