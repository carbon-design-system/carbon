### Migrations

Included within the CLI are a number of migrations available to you to be ran on
your project's source files.

Migrations are automated scripts (codemods) ran using the
[jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) runner, that will apply
intelligent transformations to your code.

These migrations range from simple automations like a find and replace of import
statements, to more sophisticated migrations that rewrite component prop usage,
configuration, and set up. The source of these migrations can be viewed within
the
[transforms folder](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/upgrade/transforms).
Each is tested against a series of test fixtures to ensure transforms are
predictable and consistently provide the intended output.
