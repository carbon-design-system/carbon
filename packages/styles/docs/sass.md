## Overview

The `@carbon/styles` package provides the Sass files needed to include every
style for the Carbon Design System. It includes entrypoints for themes, tokens,
CSS helpers, components, and more.

### Files

The following is a table of all files that are available to use. While there may
be additional files that you can import from directly within the package, these
are the public entrypoints that are maintained and follow semantic versioning
between version updates.

## Breakpoint

| Import                                   | Filepath                |
| :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/breakpoint';` | `scss/_breakpoint.scss` |

## Colors

The colors package will give you access to each swatch from the IBM Design Language. You can refer to a color by its swatch and grade.

Access these color tokens for your project by using `@use`. For example: 

```scss
 @use '@carbon/styles/scss/colors';
```

| Import                               | Filepath            |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/colors';` | `scss/_colors.scss` |

For more information checkout our [Files](#files) docs.

## Config

| Import                               | Filepath            |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/config';` | `scss/_config.scss` |

## Feature Flags

| Import                                      | Filepath                   |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------- |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/feature-flags';` | `scss/_feature-flags.scss` |

## Grid

| :--------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/grid';` | `scss/_grid.scss` |

## Motion

The motion package provides helper functions, mixins, and duration tokens to add motion into your project.

You can bring in the motion package and tokens by using `@use`. 

For example:

```scss
 @use '@carbon/styles/scss/motion';
 .dropdown--arrow {
  transition: transform $duration-fast-02 motion(standard, productive);
 }
```
| Import                               | Filepath            |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/motion';` | `scss/_motion.scss` |

For more information checkout our [Files](#files) docs.
## Reset

| Import                              | Filepath           |
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/reset';` | `scss/_reset.scss` |

## Spacing

| Import                                | Filepath             |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------- |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/spacing';` | `scss/_spacing.scss` |

## Themes

| Import                               | Filepath            |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/themes';` | `scss/_themes.scss` |

This entrypoint re-exports the `themes` entrypoint from the `@carbon/themes`. it
provides access to the theme variables built for the Carbon Design System.

These theme variables can be used in the following way:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/themes';

// themes.$white
// themes.$g10
// themes.$g90
// themes.$g100
```

## Theme

| Import                              | Filepath           |
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme';` | `scss/_theme.scss` |

This entrypoint re-exports the `theme` entrypoint from the `@carbon/themes`.
This entrypoint exports all of the design tokens as Sass Variables, as well as
helpers for you to interact with the theme.

To use a design token from this entrypoint, you can include the filepath and
reference it as a variable.

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme';

body {
  background: theme.$background;
}
```

The value of the `theme.$background` token is a CSS Custom Property. For
example, `theme.$background` would have the value `var(--cds-background)`. To
get the value of a token, you will need to use the `theme.get` function
described below.

For a full list of tokens available, check out our
[themes documentation](../../themes/docs/sass.md#tokens).

There are also some helpers that you can use from this entrypoint. These
include:

- `theme.get` to get access to the value of a token from the theme
- `theme.extend` to extend the current theme with new values

You can use these in the following way:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme';

@include theme.extend(
  (
    custom-token: #000000,
  )
);

.my-selector {
  background: rgba(theme.get('custom-token'), 0.1);
}
```

**Configuration**

The `@carbon/styles/scss/theme` entrypoint can be configured with the following
options:

- `$theme` to set the current theme
- `$fallback` to set the fallback theme. This value is used to get values of
  tokens if they are not defined in the current `$theme`

## Type

The type package entrypoint allows you to specifically bring type tokens into your project. The type package includes various type tokens and mixins.

To bring in the `@carbon/type` package use `@use`. For example: 

```scss
 @use '@carbon/styles/scss/type';
```

| Import                             | Filepath          |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/type';` | `scss/_type.scss` |

For more information, check out our [type](#todo) docs.
## Components

All of the styles for the components in the Carbon Design System live in the
`scss/components` directory. You can include all of the styles for a component
by including its entrypoint file. For a full list of component styles that you
can import, check out the files table below.

**Component tokens**

In some situations, you may want to change the tokens for a specific component.
To do so you will need to configure the module and provide the tokens you would
like to see changed. For example, if you wanted to change the component token
`button-separator` for `button` you would do the following:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/button' with (
  $button-separator: #e4e4e4,
);
```

**Files**

| Component | Import                                             | File                                                        |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accordion | `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/accordion';` | [`scss/components/accordion`](../scss/components/accordion) |

## Utilities

**Files**

| Import                                                | Description |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :---------- |
| `@use '@carbon/styles/scss/utilities/focus-outline';` |             |

## Configuration

You will need to configure Sass to be able to lookup packages from your
`node_modules` folder. To do this, use the `includePaths` option and set its
value to an array of locations where Sass should look to find `node_modules`
folders.

For most teams, this configuration will look like:

```json
{
  "includePaths": ["node_modules"]
}
```

For bundler specific solutions, check out the sections below for your bundler of
choice. If you can't find what you're looking for, please make an
[issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose) and
we'll try to get instructions for it added!

### `sass-loader`

[Link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-loader)

Update your `webpack.config.js` that uses `sass-loader` with the following
options passed into `sassOptions`:

```js
{
  loader: 'sass-loader',

    sassOptions: {
      includePaths: ['node_modules'],
    },
  },
}
```

### Parcel
