### Optimizing CSS bundle size

When you bring in `@carbon/styles` directly, it will include all of the styles
available for the Carbon Design System. If you would like to bring in only the
styles that you use, then we recommend structuring your imports in the following
way:

```scss
// Bring in top-level / global styles
@use '@carbon/styles/reset';

// Bring in each component that you use
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/<component>';
```

For example, if your project is only using the Accordion and Breadcrumb
components then you would do the following:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/reset';
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/accordion';
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/breadcrumb';
```
