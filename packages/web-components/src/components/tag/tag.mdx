Tags can be used to categorize items. Use short labels for easy scanning. Use
two words only if necessary to describe the status and differentiate it from
other tags.

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/tag/index.js';
```

<Markdown>{`${cdnJs({ components: ['tag'] })}`}</Markdown>
<Markdown>{`${cdnCss()}`}</Markdown>

### HTML

```html
<cds-tag type="gray" title="tag-example"> This is a tag </cds-tag>
```

## Custom icon

If you'd like to use a custom icon within the tag, import the icon and
insert it within the tag element as such:

```javascript
import Download16 from '@carbon/icons/lib/download/16.js';

function App() {
  return html`
  <cds-tag filter type="gray" title="Clear selection">
    ${Download16({ slot: 'icon' })}
    This is a tag
    </cds-tag>`;
}
```

## Read Only

Read-only tags are used to categorize, are used for labeling, and do not have
interactive functionality. Read-only tags come in several color choices and can
use optional decorative icons to delineate between multiple categories.

## Dismissible

Dismissible tags are used to remove tags that can be filtered out by the user.

When to use:

- Use DismissibleTag when you want to allow users to easily clear or dismiss
  specific filters applied to items.

You can use the events to catch the closing of the tag.

```js
document.addEventListener('cds-dismissible-tag-closed', (event) => {
  // use values here
});
```

## Selectable

Selectable tags are used to select or unselect single or multiple items.
Selectable tags can also be used in filtering by label scenarios when they do
not need to be dismissed.

When to use:

- Use selectable tags to toggle between a selected or unselected state.
- Use when needing to filter without an explicit dismissable functionality. (We
  need to be a little more specific around filtering for selectable versus
  dismissable tags).

## Operational

Operational tags enable the user to view a list of all items associated with a
given tag in different ways.

When to use:

- Use to view a list of items with the same tag in a popover, or breadcrumb
  detail view.

When not to use:

- Do not use operational tags as a replacement for links that direct you to an
  entirely different page or launch you out to another tab.
- Do not use in combination with Dismissable tags. Instead, consider letting the
  user enter an "edit mode" to dismiss tags.

## With AI Label

Tag with AI label is now stable for Read Only tags. This addition changes the
visual appearance of the component and introduces an AI explainability feature
when AI is present in the component.


## `<cds-tag>` attributes and properties

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g.
`<cds-tag disabled>`) and `false` means not setting the attribute (e.g.
`<cds-tag>` without `disabled` attribute).
