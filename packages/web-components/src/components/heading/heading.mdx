For people using screen readers, headings in HTML are one of the most common
ways to navigate a page. Correctly using headings and levels helps with
understanding a page and its hierarchy and can be used to jump between sections
on a page.

Normally, in a component you would have to specify the heading level manually.
This can become problematic if your component is used in various parts of a page
where the heading level needs to be different.

To help address this, the `Heading` component will automatically infer the
appropriate heading level without you having to manually specify it. To do this,
you use the `Section` component for each section of your page. Every `Heading`
component in that `Section` will use the correct heading level.
