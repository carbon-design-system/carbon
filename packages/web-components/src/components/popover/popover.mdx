## Overview

The `cds-popover` is a primitive component used to build custom components which
render over other elements on the page.

The popover component accepts two items as children: a trigger element and a
`cds-popover-content` which contains the content to be rendered inside of the
popover.

The `open` attribute allows you to control the visibility of the popover. This
is often tracked in state and is toggled based on the trigger render inside of
the popover. A trigger must be an interactive element and in most cases it will
be a `<button />`.

## Alignment

The `align` attribute allows you to specify where your content should be placed
relative to the popover. For example, if you provide `align="top"` to the
popover component then the popover will render above your component. Similarly,
if you provide `align="bottom"` then the popover will render below your
component.

You can also configure the placement of the caret, if it is enabled, by choosing
between `left` and `right` or `bottom` and `top`, depending on where your
popover is being rendered.

If you are using `align="top"`, then you can choose between `align="top-left"`
and `align="top-right"`. These options will place the caret closer to the left
or right edges of the popover.

If you are using `align="left"` or `align="right"`, you can use `top` or
`bottom` to control this alignment.

## Appearance

The popover component has several attributes which you can use to customize its
appearance, including:

- `caret`: to conditionally display a `caret` or render the popover directly
  beside the trigger element
- `dropShadow`: to display a drop shadow on the popover content
- `highContrast`: to display a high contrast variant of the popover
