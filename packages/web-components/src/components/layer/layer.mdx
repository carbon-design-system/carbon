The `Layer` component is used to render components on different layers. Each
layer has a specific set of token values associated with it. You can use these
tokens directly, or use contextual tokens from our styles package like `$layer`
or `$field`.

The `Layer` component accepts any `children`. Each child of a `Layer` component
is rendered using the layer tokens at that layer. `Layer` components can be
nested indefinitely, but the token sets typically end after 3 layers.

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/layer/index.js';
```

<Markdown>{`${cdnJs({ components: ['layer'] })}`}</Markdown>
<Markdown>{`${cdnCss()}`}</Markdown>

### HTML

Here we define a custom test class to define a custom padding.

```css
.example-layer-test-component {
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

```html
<cds-layer>
  <div class="example-layer-test-component">Layer 1</div>
  <cds-layer>
    <div class="example-layer-test-component">Layer 2</div>
    <cds-layer>
      <div class="example-layer-test-component">Layer 3</div>
    </cds-layer>
  </cds-layer>
</cds-layer>
```

## Setting a custom level

You can override the `level` of a `Layer` if you would like to change the
presentation of a layer in your application. This is particularly helpful if you
would like to reset the `Layer` level back to `0` or if you want to make sure a
part of a page always renders in a certain level.

```html
<cds-layer>
  <div class="example-layer-test-component">Layer 1</div>
  <cds-layer level="0">
    <div class="example-layer-test-component">Layer 1 as well</div>
    <cds-layer>
      <div class="example-layer-test-component">Layer 2</div>
    </cds-layer>
  </cds-layer>
</cds-layer>
```

## Get the current layer

If you are building a component and would like to know what layer the component
resides within, you can use the `cds-use-layer` event.

This event returns a `CustomEvent` with the current element firing the event, as
well as its layer:

```js
  document.addEventListener(`${prefix}-use-layer`, (e) => {
    const { layer, level } = (e as any).detail;

    // use values here
  })
```

If the structure of `Layer` components in your app change, the event will
automatically fire with the new level.

The level value can be one of: 0, 1, or 2 and will correspond to the level of
the current layer. This value mirrors the level prop on the Layer component.

## Layer role

As `Layer` is effectively a container component, and you can configure what the
`Layer` should be seen as in the DOM using `role`. For example, if you would
like the Layer component to be seen as a section you could write the following:

```html
<cds-layer role="section">
  <div class="example-layer-test-component">Layer 1</div>
</cds-layer>
```
