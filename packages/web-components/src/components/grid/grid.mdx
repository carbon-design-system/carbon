Carbon's grid components help developers use the
[2x Grid](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/2x-grid/overview/). The
project provides `grid` and `column` components which can be used to build a
variety of layouts. You can import these components from `@carbon/web-components`:

```js
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/grid/index';
```

<Canvas of={GridStories.Default} />

## Overview

Every layout starts with the `grid` component. You can specify a `grid` at the
top-level of your project, or at different depths provided that it can span 100%
width of its container.

Next, you will use a combination of `column` and `grid`. You can have multiple
`column` components in a `grid`, and nest `grid` components in a `column`. Each
`grid` will contain all the `column` components provided to it, as long as they
don't span more columns than the total number of columns in the grid.

To specify how many columns the `column` component should span, you can use the
`sm`, `md`, `lg` attributes. These props are shorthand versions of
the names given to each of the breakpoints defined by the
[2x Grid](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/2x-grid/overview/#breakpoints).
In the example below, we will use the `lg` prop for the large breakpoint and the
number `4` to specify that each `column` component should span 4 columns at that
breakpoint.

```js
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/grid/index';

return (
  <cds-grid>
    <cds-column lg='4'>Span 4 of 16</cds-column>
    <cds-column lg='4'>Span 4 of 16</cds-column>
    <cds-column lg='4'>Span 4 of 16</cds-column>
    <cds-column lg='4'>Span 4 of 16</cds-column>
  </cds-grid>
);
```

_Note: by default, `@carbon/styles` ships with a 16 column grid._

You can pair up multiple breakpoint props to specify how many columns the
`column` component should span at different break points. In the example below,
we will use the `sm`, `md`, and `lg` prop to specify how many columns the
`column` components should span at the small, medium, and large breakpoints.

### Debugging

It is incredibly helpful when debugging CSS Grid to use the browser developer
tools' css gutter mode to view the grid definition. Depending on the browser,
these typically provide a toggle for overlaying a schematic showing the column
and grid gap definition. With this overlay, it's much easier to visually
understand if gutter modes are configured and set properly on the grid.

Documentation on these features is available for
[Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/grid/),
[Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_grid_layouts),
and
[Safari](https://webkit.org/blog/11588/introducing-css-grid-inspector/#:~:text=If%20you're%20using%20Safari,%23css%2Dgrid%2Ddemo%20.),
among others.

## Gutter modes

There are several
[gutter modes](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/2x-grid/overview/#gutters)
that you can use depending on the layout effect you're looking to achieve. By
default, `grid` uses the wide gutter mode with a 32px gutter. However, you can
use the `condensed` prop to enable the condensed gutter mode with a 1px gutter
or the `narrow` prop to enable the narrow grid with a 16px gutter.

## Subgrid

`grid` components can be nested within one another to achieve more advanced
layout configurations. When a `grid` is a child of another `grid`, the child
will always be automatically defined as a subgrid. Subgrids should always be
contained within a `column` to ensure that the column amount/definition is
properly configured for the subgrid to inherit. Additionally, wrapping subgrids
in a `column` enables you to define responsive parameters for the column (`sm`,
`md`, etc) that the subgrid will inherit and be bound to.

## Mixed gutter modes

The same way that you can pass in `condensed` to a root `grid`, you can also
pass in `condensed` to a nested `grid` (subgrid) to enable a certain gutter mode
for only that subgrid. This can be useful when you need to mix-and-match certain
gutter modes to achieve a particular layout.

## Auto columns

Each column by default spans one single column as defined by the parent grid's
parameters.

The default track sizing functions of the grid columns are defined by the parent
grid's `grid-template-columns` property. This declares that there should be
`--cds-grid-columns` number of columns, and each column should by default span a
`minmax()` of `0` columns minimum, or a maximum of `--cds-grid-column-size`
(`1fr`).

The values of these custom properties can be changed to modify the default
behavior of columns.

## Offset columns

You can offset your `column` components by a specific amount of columns using
the object form for each breakpoint prop. This specific prop type allows you to
pass in an object to each breakpoint prop and this object has two keys, `span`
and `start`, which allow you to specify the total numbers of columns the
`column` component spans, and how many columns to offset it by.

You can specify either prop in this object form, and can mix-and-match across
breakpoints. For example, the following snippet will have the `Column` component
span two columns at the small breakpoint and then four columns at the medium
breakpoint. At the medium breakpoint, it will be offset by two columns.

```html
<cds-column sm='2' md='span:4 start:2'></cds-column>
```

## FAQ

### How can I hide columns at a certain breakpoint?

To hide a column at a specific breakpoint, you should specify 0 for the span of
the column at that particular breakpoint. For example, you can use the following
two forms for specifying column span and pass in 0 to either to hide the column
at the small breakpoint.

```html
<cds-column sm='0'></cds-column>
<cds-column sm='span:0'></cds-column>
```

### Can I nest grid components?

Yes! While the CSS Grid `subgrid` property is still
[not well supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-subgrid), css custom
properties are used to enable nested grids with inherited column definitions.
View the subgrid story documentation for more information on how this works and
how to use it.
