The `@carbon/web-components` codebase ships with a number of feature flags. These feature
flags enable new behavior and styling, allowing you to opt-in to new (and
sometimes breaking) changes while using the current version. A feature flag may
be configured in web-components, sass, or both.

This section in the storybook documents each feature flag that is available and
how to configure it. Folders and stories within this section in storybook show
components with all feature flags turned on.

## Turning on feature flags in web-components

Use the `<feature-flags>` web component to turn on a feature flag for a portion of your
application. You can configure multiple feature flags at the same time by passing them as attributes or properties to the element.

```jsx
<feature-flag enableV12TileDefaultIcons="true" enableASecondFeatureFlag="true">
  <cds-tile/>
</feature-flag>;
```

The `<feature-flag>` component can be placed at any point in your react tree and
will impact all children components. You can turn on feature flags for your
entire app, or only certain pages/routes/sections of your application.

## Turning on Style feature flags in web-components

To enable a style-based feature flag, add the feature flag name as an attribute on the component.

```jsx
<cds-clickable-tile
  enable-experimental-tile-contrast
  >
  Clickable tile
</cds-clickable-tile>
```
