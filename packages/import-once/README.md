# @carbon/import-once

> Sass helper for importing files only once. Used in the Carbon Design System

## Getting started

To install `@carbon/import-once` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @carbon/import-once
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/import-once
```

## Usage

`@carbon/import-once` is helpful when needing to guarantee that a module is
loaded only once. It does this by exporting a `exports` mixin that you can use.

This mixin is particularly useful when you have a situation where your work
might share common dependencies that you don't want duplicated. For example,
imagine we had modules `a.scss` and `b.scss` that both import `c.scss`. Using
the `exports` mixin from `@carbon/import-once` will guarantee that `c.scss` is
loaded only once.

This looks like:

```scss
// a.scss
@import 'c';

// b.scss
@import 'c';

// c.scss
@import '@carbon/import-once/scss/import-once';

@include exports('c') {
  // ...
}
```
