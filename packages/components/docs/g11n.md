# Notes of globalization

- `carbon-components` lets you define most of the markup, which contains most of
  the translatable content. Ensure application content in the markup is
  translatable as needed.
- Also make sure that list items in the application markup are correctly ordered
  for the same reason.
- Date picker component relies on the G11N features in
  [`Flatpickr` library](<(https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/)>). See
  [here](../src/components/date-picker/README.md#localization) for more details.
- Some styles in our Sass code have directives of
  [RTLCSS library](https://rtlcss.com/learn/usage-guide/control-directives/index.html).
