# @carbon/icons-handlebars

> Handlebars helpers for IBM Design Language icons in digital and software
> products using the Carbon Design System

## Getting started

To install `@carbon/icons-handlebars` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @carbon/icons-handlebars
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/icons-handlebars
```

## Usage

You can use the `carbon-icon` helper by passing in the name of the icon you'd
like to render. For example:

```hbs
{{carbon-icon 'Accessibility32'}}
```

This will output the default `<svg>` markup for the `Accessibility` icon at
32x32. You can pass in additional properties like `aria-label` by doing:

```hbs
{{carbon-icon 'Accessibility32' aria-label='Accessibility label'}}
```

These attributes will be applied to the top-level `<svg>` node.
