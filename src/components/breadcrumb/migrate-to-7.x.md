### HTML

The `bx--breadcrumb--lg` modifier class has been removed in `7.x` and is no longer in use.

### SCSS

The `_breadcrumb.scss` file is now located at __src/components/breadcrumb/_breadcrumb.scss__. You will need to update any `@import` statements for this file to reflect this change.

```scss
@import 'path_to_node_modules/@console/bluemix-components/src/components/breadcrumb/breadcrumb';
```
