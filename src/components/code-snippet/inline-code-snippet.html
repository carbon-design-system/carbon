<!-- This should be on a white background -->
<p>Here is an example of a text that a user would be reading. In this paragraph would be 
  <button data-copy-btn="" class="bx--snippet bx--snippet--inline" aria-label="Copy code" tabindex="0">
    <code>inline code</code>
    <div class="bx--btn--copy__feedback" data-feedback="Copied!"></div>
  </button> 
  that the user could look at and copy in to their code editor.</p>
