## Checking for known issues

### Github

We use Github to track our bugs. If you have a bug to report or wish to request
a new feature, please check the
[existing issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) before
opening a new one. There may already be something similar in the works.

### Carbon website

Please take some time to explore the content on this website before opening an
issue. The site is comprehensive and most guidelines and components are well
documented.
