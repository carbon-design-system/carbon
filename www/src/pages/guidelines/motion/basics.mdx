### Motion can bring the screen to life, guide users through complex experiences, and help move them forward—from here to there, now to next, start to finish—and make progress.

## Carbon in motion

[Carbon components](../../components/overview/) have motion built in for
microinteractions. However, the motion design of the overarching UI — that is,
how the components interact with each other and enter and exit the page itself —
is up to each product team to implement. Use this guidance to customize,
combine, coordinate, and choreograph this aspect of motion in the UI.

## Style

Carbon recognizes different types of moments in users' experience and offers two
styles of motion—_productive_ motion, and _expressive_ motion. The motion curves
are designed to reflect the duality of man and machine.

Productivity and expression are both essential to an interface. Reserve
expressive motion for occasional, important moments, to better capture the
user’s attention and offer a rhythmic break to the productive experience.

### Productive motion

Productive motion creates a sense of efficiency and responsiveness, while remain
subtle and out of the way. Productive motion is appropriate for moments when the
user needs to focus on completing tasks. Microinteractions in Carbon such as
button states, dropdowns, revealing additional information, or rendering data
tables and visualizations were all designed with productive motion.

### Expressive motion

Expressive motion delivers enthusiastic, vibrant, and highly visible movement.
Use expressive motion for significant moments such as opening a new page,
clicking the primary action button, or when the movement itself conveys a
meaning. System alerts and the appearance of notification boxes are great cases
for expressive motion.

## Easing

Strictly linear movement appears unnatural to the human eye. Elements on the
screen should speed up quickly and slow down smoothly, obeying the physics of a
light-weight material. "Easing curves" describe the precise amount of
accelerations in motion. We commonly use one of these three types of easing.

<Video vimeoId="310582370" />

</DoDontExample>
</Column>
</Row>

<br />

Avoid easing curves that are unnatural, distracting, or purely decorative. IBM
motion is essential and efficient, guiding users to value as quickly as
possible.

<DoDontExample full_width="true" label="Do not use easing curves that suggest bounce, stretch, or sudden stops.">

</Row>

### Standard easing

Use `standard-easing` when an element is visible from the beginning to the end
of a motion. Expanding tiles and the sorting of table rows are good examples.

| Style      | IBM Motion package             | CSS                             | After Effects              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Productive | `motion(standard, productive)` | cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0.38, 0.9) | outgoing 20%, incoming 62% |
| Expressive | `motion(standard, expressive)` | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.14, 0.3, 1) | outgoing 40%, incoming 70% |

### Entrance easing

With this style, an element quickly appears and slows down to a stop. Use
`entrance-ease` when adding elements to the view, such as a modal or toaster
appearing. Elements moving in response to the user's input, such as a dropdown
opening or toggle switching should also use this style.

| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Productive | `motion(entrance, productive)` | cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.38, 0.9) | outgoing 0%, incoming 62% |
| Expressive | `motion(entrance, expressive)` | cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.3, 1)    | outgoing 0%, incoming 70% |

### Exit easing

Use `exit-easing` when removing elements from view, such as closing a modal or
toaster. The element speeds up as it exits from view, implying that its
departure from the screen is permanent.

An exception to exits: if an element leaves the view but stays nearby, ready to
reappear upon user action, use standard easing instead. A good example of this
is a side panel. The panel leaves the view, but slows down as it exits, implying
that it would come to rest just outside the view, and ready to be recalled.

### Summary on easing

The
[IBM motion package](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-elements/tree/master/packages/motion)
has the easing curves stored for fast access. This is the recommended method to
call an easing curve and stay connected to receive any future updates.

| Easing curve    | Productive                     | Expressive                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Standard easing | `motion(standard, productive)` | `motion(standard, expressive)` |
| Entrance easing | `motion(entrance, productive)` | `motion(entrance, expressive)` |
| Exit easing     | `motion(exit, productive)`     | `motion(exit, expressive)`     |

If you are unable to use the above method, cubic-bezier curve notation is the
standard way to express easing curves.

| Easing curve    | Productive                      | Expressive                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Standard easing | cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0.38, 0.9) | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.14, 0.3, 1) |
| Entrance easing | cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.38, 0.9)   | cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.3, 1)      |
| Exit easing     | cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 1, 0.9)    | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.14, 1, 1)   |

## Duration

Duration is calculated based on the style and size of the motion. Among the two
motion styles, productive motion is significantly faster than expressive motion.
Motion’s duration should be dynamic based on the size of the animation; the
larger the change in distance (traveled) or size (scaling) of the element, the
longer the animation takes.

<DoDontExample correct label="Duration contrast between a taller and a shorter component.">

</Column>
</Row>

<br />

When custom duration is possible, please use the
[Motion Generator](https://ibm.github.io/motion/) to get the customized duration
calculated for your element. Carbon uses a non-linear duration scale to achieve
better perceived consistency across all distances.

### Duration tokens

Dynamic duration is an upcoming built-in feature for Carbon components and a
part of the motion package. Currently, there are six static value tokens for
easier implementation.

| Token                   | Usage                                                         | Value |     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --- |
| `duration--fast-01`     | Micro-interactions such as button and toggle                  | 70ms  |     |
| `duration--fast-02`     | Micro-interactions such as fade                               | 110ms |     |
| `duration--moderate-01` | Micro-interactions, small expansion, short distance movements | 150ms |     |
| `duration--moderate-02` | Expansion, system communication, toast                        | 240ms |     |
| `duration--slow-01`     | Large expansion, important system notifications               | 400ms |     |
| `duration--slow-02`     | Background dimming                                            | 700ms |     |
