## Design and production guidelines

Don't see the icon you need in the library? Make your own! Follow these guidelines to ensure visual consistency and proper formatting.

- All icons should be unique and not redundant with any existing icons in the system. Search the [library](/guidelines/iconography/library) for the keyword(s) associated with your proposed new icon to ensure that it is not already represented.
- All icons should adhere to the [IBM Design Language visual style](https://w3.ibm.com/design/language/elements/icons/).
- All icons should comply with IBM [accessibility standards](/guidelines/accessibility/overview).
- All icons should be usable across all supported platforms and devices.
- All icons should be understandable by a global audience of users, regardless of nationality or language.

## Making an icon

- Create a 16 x 16 or 32 x 32 px artboard for each icon.
- 16 px icons should have 1 px padding. 32 px icons should have 2 px padding.
- Set your workspace up from the start to snap to pixels and round values to whole pixels to avoid correcting shapes later.
- Never use center borders. Centering can cause half pixels.
- Avoid using the line tool; use the rectangle tool instead. The line tool will place the vector on half pixels.
- Be aware of automatic alignments which can place vectors on uneven or half pixels.
- Ungroup icon layers completely. The icon should be on the top-most layer in your artboard.
- Make sure to properly name layers and artboards _(these names will also be exported into the code)_.

### Production-ready

To be considered production-ready, all icon submissions must be delivered in SVG format at 16 x 16 px (for integration with Carbon components) or 32 x 32 (for service icons).

- Icons should be at whole pixels. No decimals are allowed in x and y coordinates or width and height fields.
- Each artboard and the artwork within it must be aligned to the pixel grid.
- All strokes must be expanded and at full pixel values.
- All possible shapes and paths should be combined.

## Exporting SVGs

### Export SVGs from Sketch

1. Draw a 16 x 16 or 32 x 32 px artboard. 16 px icons should have 1 px padding. 32 px icons should have 2 px padding.
2. Place the icon squarely on the artboard, making sure it's aligned to the pixel grid.
3. Convert all strokes to outlines `(Shift + ⌘ + O)`
4. Select any overlapping shapes and click the Union icon from the top navigation to merge all of the shapes together.
5. Make sure the icon is at `#000000` and has no additional styling.
6. Select the entire artboard (not just the icon).
7. Click `Make Exportable` at the bottom of the right toolbar in Sketch.
8. In the `Export` widget select "SVG" in the format dropdown.
9. Click `Export 'Artboard-Name'`.
10. Name icon with the `#name--modifier` convention _(i.e._ `copy.svg`, `copy--glyph.svg`, `add.svg`, `add--glyph.svg`).

### Export SVGs from Adobe Illustrator

1. Draw a 16 x 16 or 32 x 32 px artboard. 16 px icons should have 1 px padding. 32 px icons should have 2 px padding.
2. Place the icon squarely on the artboard, making sure it's aligned to the pixel grid.
3. Expand all strokes `Object` → `Expand`.
4. Select all overlapping shapes and click the "Unite" icon in the Pathfinder panel to merge all of the shapes together.
5. Make sure the icon is at `#000000` and has no additional styling.
6. Select `File` → `Save a Copy...` from the top navigation.
7. On the `Format` dropdown select "SVG."
8. Below `Format` select `Use Artboard`, then select either all or a range of artboards, depending on your need.
9. Click `Save`.
10. The `SVG Options` dialog will then open.
11. Make sure the preferences are the same as in the image below.
