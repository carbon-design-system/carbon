## General guidance

_Content switcher_ manipulates the content shown following an exclusive or “either/or” pattern.
It is used to toggle between two or more content sections within the same space on screen. Only one section can be shown at a time.

#### Text

Be concise and specific. Titles have a max of two words.

#### Default selection

Based on usage, there should be a default selection. The default selection is always the first option in a switcher.

#### Content switcher vs. toggle

The content switcher is used for large groups of content, as opposed to the [toggle](/components/toggle) which is meant for a “yes/no” or “on/off” binary decision.
