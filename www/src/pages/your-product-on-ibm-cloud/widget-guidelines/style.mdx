## Structure

### Anatomy

Each widget has a <b>title bar</b> and a <b>content section</b>. The title bar is standard for all widgets, but the content section varies depending on the widget type. 



![Widget Terminology](images/widget_terminology.png)



#### Title
Identifies the widget. Max characters: 23 (includes spaces)

#### Title link
Links users to a more complete view of information summarized in the widget. The title link should be as specific as possible (i.e. "view resources" not "view all"). Max characters: 15

#### Call to action 
Provides the user with a quick action. This element is optional and can incorporate a "plus" icon if appropriate. Max characters: 23


### Padding

The widget padding should be 1.5rem (24px) for the top, left, right, and bottom of the content area. All widgets should have the same padding, regardless of size.

### Lists

You can style lists with or without rulers separating the rows. In both cases, spacing between the rows should be 32 pixels.

## States 

Widgets have five distinct states, each with their own styling: <b>normal, empty, permission, error,</b> and <b>loading</b>. 

- In the normal state, text is left-aligned except for calls to action
- In every other state, content is center-aligned with an illustration and small, grey text


### Normal state

The normal state is the primary state. It occurs when a widget has been populated with data that the user has permission to see.

### Empty state

The empty state occurs when the user has no data to populate the widget. 



![Empty State](images/empty_state_small.png)



### Permission state


This state occurs when a user does not have permission to see the widget data. For example a user may not have permission to manage other users or view usage data.



![Permission State](images/permission_state_small.png)



### Error state

The error state occurs when data fails to load.



![Permission State](images/error_state _small.png)



### Loading state

The loading state appears while the widget data loads. Static headers are displayed as text and loading content is replaced by skeletons.

## Content

### Tone
Leverage the [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com) for guidance on capitalization, tone, voice, and terminology. In addition to the content guidance in Carbon, use the embedded assistance checklist.




### Illustrations

All dashboard illustrations should be 72x72px and should match the illustration style of these [sample dashboard illustrations](https://ibm.box.com/s/f2efq7ylbuwlfwnpwdqzk45c6mkz17bc).

### Icons

Leverage the [Carbon Design System icon library](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/iconography/library) for icons within the widget iteslf. 


## Widget tiles

Each widget has a tile that can be seen when users open the "Add widget" side panel during dashboard customization. Each tile features the <b>widget icon</b>, <b>widget title</b>, and <b>short description</b> (max characters: 35).
