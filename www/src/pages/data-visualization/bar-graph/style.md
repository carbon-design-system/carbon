style specifications.

## Structure

The height of a bar varies based on the value for that data increment. The width
of a bar is calculated based on the width of the graph and the number of bars.
In other words, the more bars there are in a graph the thinner the bars will be
and vice versa.

A grouped bar graph follows the same width and height rules for a single bar
graph data set. Spacing between groups of bar graphs is larger than bars within
a group. Maintain a minimum of 2px between bars within a group to meet color
contrast standards.
